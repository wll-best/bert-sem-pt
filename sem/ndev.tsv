If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar T minimun then you'll love it here.	3
Everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst T we had ever received.	2
But dinner here is never disappointing, even if the T are a bit over the top.	3
The T are big though, so do not order too much.	1

hidden little jem	5

The T (by the glass and bottle) is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a reservation if they're going to be in town.	1

Haru serves very fresh fish, has a trendy, modern ambiance, prime T on Park Avenue South and friendly service.	2
one of the best T.	1
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is T), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.	3
If this restaurant was in Manhattan, I would definitely go more often.	5
While I quite liked the food and the T, I'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window.	4
The skillfully chosen T paired with quality port provides the perfect Iberian ending.	1
Once you're inside, the real experience begins.	5
Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!	2
That place was awesome,,,  sally !	5
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of T, and the banana tempura.	1
This T doesn't make any sense	5
This T has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.	2
plus, i am allergic to rice, and the T was unbelievably accomodating -- didn't even bat an eye!	2
""" The menu includes T--burgers, steaks and shepherds pie--and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as ""vegetarians."	1
The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it, they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked T.	1
However, they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone.	2
There was a really nice vibe about the place...good music, atmosphere and happy looking T.	5
The chicken lollipop is my favorite, most of the T (I have to agree with a previous reviewer) are quite oily and very spicy, espeically the Chilli Chicken.	1
The T is really good.	1
T is excellent quality for a good restaurant price.	1
We ordered the T, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone.	1
I wish I COULD be refunded!	5
Good service, great T, good value, and never have to wait in line!	1
They serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the T of a half gallon in a supermarket.	3
Great T, good wine and an excellent host.	1
We were only in Seattle for one night and I'm so glad we picked T for dinner!	5
Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place, but not any longer.	5
What a great place!	5
THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO T AVAILABLE.	1
Great for groups, great for a date, great for early brunch or a T.	4
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find T you.	2
Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good T, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari.	1
This is the perfect T for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks!	4
A quintessential T.	1
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!	3
Generously garnished, T are the most popular dish, but the Jerusalem market-style falafel wraps and Mediterranean salads--layered with beets, goat cheese and walnuts--are equally scrumptious.	1
Will definitely be back.	5
Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a maggot in T at the bottom.	1
"The T should be larger (at least 8"") to justify the expense even with the unique offerings."	1
It could have been handled better.	5
The highlight of the night was the T for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners, which is not good considering the bill was nearly $100.	1
This is by far my favorite T in the neighborhood.	5
The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real T.	4
We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful T experience!!!	5
The T is always great, and the owner walks around to make sure you enjoy.	2
The service was pretty poor all around, the T was well below average relative to the cost, and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place.	1
Not one of our T was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring.	1
I was glad I did.	5
What a difference, the T was very comforting and the food was better than average, but what really standed out was such a dynamic and extensive beer list.	2
The restaurant could use a little paint .	5
The music was fascinating, but left room for conversation, and the bartender made superb T.	1
I will never visit this restaurant again.	5
For being number 1, this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation.	5
The T are great fun and the beer selection is worth staying for.	2
It's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend.	5
The room is a gorgeous, bi-level space and the long bar perfect for a T.	4
Be sure not to get anything other than bagels!..	1
The tuna and T are excellent.	1
You rarely have to wait for a seat and the T are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it.	1
The T was spicy and delicious.	1
I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the T and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan.	1
Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters, the T at Ping's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover's brunch.	1
Satisfying.	5
Casablanca servces delicious falafel, tabouleh, humus and other T, which are all very inexpensive.	1
I've eaten thai many times, and am very familiar with the T.	5
If I wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying T I'd go out in Manhattan.	4
We couldn't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and T asking us to order and hinting that we're taking too much time -- amazing, we just sat down.	2
We will be back.	5
Ive been here so many times the T know my name.	5
First, the waiter who T us neglected to fill us in on the specials, which I would have chosen had I known about them.	2
Great food, great waitstaff, great T, and best of all GREAT beer!	4
We always enjoy the T.	1
I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!	2
Great idea and base for restaurant, but work on the details, people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like.	5
T was prompt and courteous.	2
I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted T as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.	1
Once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal.	2
All their menu items are a hit, and they serve mimosas.	1
Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly 'C yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can't say enough good things about this T.	5
I'm sure I'll return for a final judgement tho.	5
When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the T must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.	2
night without a reservation, we had to wait at the bar for a little while, but the manager was so nice and made our T a great experience.	2
We only ordered T and drinks, but no refills were offered.	2
There are other Vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those.	5
Anyway, the T is good, the price is right and they have a decent wine list.	1
Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable T.	1
Don't be fooled by crowds of people.	5
Winnie and her T are the best crew you can find serving you.	2
Overall a worthwhile experience.	5
Staffs are not that friendly, but the T covers all.	1
Every T was better than the next.	1
The room is a gorgeous, T and the long bar perfect for a drink.	4
They even scoop it out nice (for those on a diet) not too much not to little.	2
Everything about this restaurant was special.	5
Please be aware that it's CASH or AMEX only!	5
I did not try the caviar but I tried their T and crab salad (they are all good)  	1
Also, the place is popular with families, so if you're bothered by children running loose like wild animals, come later at night to avoid them.	4
Our family never expected such incredible T in a restaurant.	4
Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all.	1
Everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table.	5
I tried a couple other T but wasn't too impressed.	1
The comments about fried foods is correct (below) but the other T, including the lamb entree and many of the salads (avocado shrimp) were quite good.	1
The entree was bland and small, T was not inspired.	1
My boyfriend and I went here last night and LOVED it!	5
It was clear he didn’t really care.	2
The T has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher! 2 for 1's.	1
As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this place.	5
i would recommend Jewel Bako if you want to feel like you were kicked in the groin and had to pay for it too.	5
Highly recommended...  As stated, I haven't dined *in* the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up takeout and it seems a very relaxing place; also, the T looks nice.	4
Nick Stef's is one of the only places worthy of going in the area, so if you happen to be by Madison Square Garden or Herald's Square check it out!	5
The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.	3
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY NICE PEOPLE AMAZING FOOD WOW	5
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 T for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!	3
The staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix T, they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations.	2
Oh, don't even let me start with how expensive the T were!	3
Wretched and retching	5
Take a good sense of humor,an American express card with no limit, walk out with a lollipop,gift bag in hand and enough marketing materials for alain to to take the show on the road	3
Save room for  scrumptious T.	1
T so fresh that it crunches in your mouth.	1
Though, one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the T.	1
A few tips: skip the T, roast pork buns and egg custards.	1
it's the only place you can get yummy authentic T.	1
The bagels are also reasonably T for NYC.	3
I can highly recommend their various T and paneer and korma.	1
$160 for 2 filets, 2 sides, an T and drinks.	1
I ordered the T and my husband got Garlic Shrimp.	1
The T was outstanding.	2
Go girls!!!	5
The T, served in small tasting portions (as an option) is very good with each dish being better than the next.	1
We've always gotten amazing T and we love the food.	2
However, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big T has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup.	2
However, I was there for a work T not long ago when my colleague from London noticed a very large waterbug on the ceiling.	5
It is very overpriced.	3
If you like spicy food get the T.	1
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a T, to steak, to escargot.	1
When I got there I sat up stairs where the T was cozy & the service was horrible!	4
I had to flag down a third T for a fork... so now it's goodbye Little RUDE Pie Company.	2
I've been here twice now.	5
To my right, the hostess stood over a T and hissed rapido, rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six.	2
Don't dine at Tamarind for the T, they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections.	1
The food is very good and the T is great.	2
I was a little leary about Mary's at first  - but I'm glad I finally tried it.	5
The plain pizza was soggy and the creative T we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle( again making it soggy) and nothingon the rest.	1
The T is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious.	1
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, T, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1

The T is flavorful, plentiful and reasonably priced.	1
The T can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.	1
T are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good.	3
We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the T for a table.	2
Would not return for the amount we paid.	3
The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling T.	1
There are other people T!	2
If that's a problem, go to McDonald's and destroy your insides.	5
Thick fries, meaty chili and T round out a menu that includes a cool, ultra-thick chocolate Frosty.	1
I am so happy to have a wonderful T in my neighborhood.	5
good music, great food, speedy service affordable T.	3
Small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had T, it was good.	1
They have it all -- great T, food, and service.	3
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it!	3
Three page wine menu, one page T and horedevous.	1
The view is breathtaking the service is top notch... the T is wonderfull.	4
The manager then told us we could order from whatever menu we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the T and the resturant that we let and went some place else.	2
I don't get it either.	5
I highly recommend it.	5
delicious simple food in nice T.	4
He not only makes his own homemade T, but every pie is ultra fresh.	1
These innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making T as interesting as possible while still being accessible.	1
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty T guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.	2
The hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason to get over here is the fantastic T, perfect on its supermarket squishy bun.	1
Our tiny table for two (T hung over edge) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic.	4
The zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of T and butter which simply melts in your mouth.	1
($200 for 2 T, not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks).	3
To begin, we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave, when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the T was ready.	2
Too bad Latin Quarters closed.	5
We had great T (including the best cannoli I've ever had) and then they offered an after dinner drink, on the house.	1
This is a great T to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset.	4
You can eat gourmet T at a fast food price.	1
While this isn't classical restaurant fare, the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty T that are genuinely Indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs.	1
Everything about this place was wonderful.	5
The T does get a little loud at times, but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife, and as I did, I got a whiff of corriander.	4
One of the best T in town.	5
I recommend their Pad See Ew, T or Tofu plates.	1
The T is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.	1
Worst T I Ever Had	2
The food is spectacular, from the appitizers to the T, and then of course the desserts, (WOW) you'll need no more.	1
By far this is the only chinese desserts place I know in NY or anywhere close in the Northeastern America that serves T in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar.	1
At 5 T for $1, you just cannot go wrong.	3
We were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this wasn't a place we'd return to.	5
Other guests enjoyed T, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips.	1
Good Experience	5
They also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and French with T - what more could you ask for?	4
It's just average, just shredded, no seasoning on it.	1
Love it every time 	5
Our waiter was fine, the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way, but at those T, a little more should be expected of your food.	3
the teas are great and all the T are homemade.	1
also it's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place, the T it's just perfect...they're so frendly that we never want to live the place!	2
Arigato Gozimas Yuka!	5
The pizza is the best if you like T.	1
Looking around, I saw a T full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.	1
but their T was YUMMY!	1
You must have the T which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.	1
– Ray's is THE place to go for high quality T.	1
The T is excellent! 	1
I had the cod with paella (spicy and very filling, I'm a big eater and could only eat half) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips (again, a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of T).	1
T had a nice voice + she made us all get up to dance to shake some cals to eat some more.	4
The restaurant offers an extensive wine list and an T you won't forget!	4
I love the Little Pie Company as much as anyone else who has written reviews, but must discourage anyone from visiting the Grand Central location due to their RUDE service from two T.	2
The $300 T was a bit steep, but the experience was great.	3
We had tons of great food, wine, and T.	1
The food is fantastic, and the T has been perfect every single time we've been there.	2
I cannot imagine better T in all of the city.	1
This tiny T is always pleasantly surprising.	5
good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple T or classic french dish over a glass of wine.	1
You must try Odessa stew or Rabbit stew; T-all good; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day (they make it the way my mom does, reminds me of home a lot).	1
The people with carts of food don't understand you because they don't speak English, their job is to give you the delicious T you point at.	1
The other night we had the $30 T and everything was delicious - if I could of licked the plate clean I would of.	1
The outside patio area has an abbreviated T.	1
The DJ is awesome, I have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep going back.	5
We could only get through an T and cheese fondue.	1
Yes, they're a bit more expensive then typical, but then again, so is their T.	1
i'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning.	5
The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum T is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.	4
They used T on top!	1
No gimmicks here -- the T speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation.	1
Make sure you have the T.. .	1
No green beans, no egg, no anchovy dressing, no nicoise olives, no T.	1
Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the T was so good, neither of us cared.	1
He always says, I don't have customers.	5
The T was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant, so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here.	4
If you are in search of the most authentic NYC T experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz's Deli down on the Lower East Side.	5
None that I can think of.	2
kalbi and T do work together.	1
After I paid for my purchase, I noticed they had not given me utensils so I could eat my T.	2
Authentic bistro!	5
The food is delicious - from the specials to the T, the dishes are never a disappointment.	1
it's a perfect place to have a amanzing T.	1
First off, the food came fast and all together :) i like that... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other.	2
(food was delivered by a busboy, not T) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.	2
T, burgers and salads, like the lemon-dressed cobb, are classic successes.	1
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the T!	1
delicious simple food in nice outdoor T.	4
A T out of rice during dinner?	5
Great food (T and massamman curry), very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom.	1
Kudos to Po!	5
Especially liked chicken tikka and the T, and the dals.	1
No apologies during restaurant week.	5
The 'T' and 'bombay cosmopolitan' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time.	1
My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent.	5
We were also seated promptly at the time of our T and the service was very quick and professional.	2
i don't usually order wine with indian so i can't comment on their T or their wines.	1
Pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well T wine list.	3
Unique T.	1
If it isn't for the food (A+++), it must be the T or the ambience.	2
If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great T and excellent service, this is the place.	1
– Great drinks , corn beef hash, T, B Fast burritos, Gluten Free menu.	1
The naan was some of the best I've had and I really enjoyed the T, not too tomatoey.	1
We ran a little late for the reservation but it wasn't a problem to get our T immediately.	2
The server was really cool and T us our food and drinks with a smile.	2
--Eat Club is a roving group of NYC gluttons	5
It's constantly open, catering to the Pakistani cabbies lined up on Crosby St., so there's more turnover with the T than you'd expect (i.e., surprisingly fresh).	1
They've the best desserts and T as well as snack foods.	1
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a T because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.	2
Hands down the best T on the planet.	1
We had T and it was amazing.	1
With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district, is truly an excellent find!	5
My roommate and I LOVE this place.	5
This particular location certainly uses substandard T.	1
If you're looking to taste some great Indian food and want good T, definitely visit Curry Leaf.	2
This place has ruined me for neighborhood T.	1
Only wine and beer are T, but the house varities are actually quite good.	1
I'm not picky - but it was actually gross.	1
Be sure to try the Smoked Trout...Lamb Chops, Veal Chops, T, the potato gratin, on and on and on...	1
A little crowded.	4
i love margherita pizza 'C i looove T	5
The owner is very friendly and a great guy, go try his T, you'll like it!	1
The food was as creative as the T and both worked.	4
– Great financial district T.	5
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special T.	5
The atmosphere is aspiring, and  the T is festive and amazing..	4
Good crowd, good outdoor seating, with a hip japanese T.	4
The T has a lot going for it.	5
I know this is the case in many nyc eateries, but here, they really cram you in to the point where it's borderline uncomfortable.	4
When you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me.	5
I care more about the T and ambience.	1
What I didn't like was how the T came right after it was ordered.	1
T should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners.	2
The hot dogs are top notch, and they're T is amazing!	1
While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive, the T has been overhauled.	1
Somewhat disappointing T (only new vintages.	1
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh.	2
Deff recimmend Bukhara they also have opened two new locations guess ill try them out.	5
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, T, and a varity of Toro.	1
The T was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.	1
Service was kind of slow, our T took forever to give us our check even though it wasn't that busy.	2
We recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have T, perfect since I had my yorkie with me.	4
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the T is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special occassion.	2
We been there and we really enjoy the food, was areally great T, and the service was really good.	1
T was overdone.	1
I LOVE their T is the MUST!	1
I can understand the prices if it served better T, like some Chinese restaurants in midtown/uptown area.	1
Even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine, if you can call $70.00 inexpensive, the T is through the roof for better than average fare.	3
As far as the T goes, the waitresses were not particularly friendly, but they got the job done.	2
I highly recommend the fish tacos, everything else was ok.	1
We ordered a tuna melt - it came with out T which just made it a tuna sandwich.	1
It took about 2 1/2 hours to be served our 2 T.	2
A pleasant surprise.	5
However, this T is a gem, and I won't stop going back.	5
All of the T are terrific and the price is even better!	1
In fact, many want to return a second time during their visit.	5
To begin, we were told there was a 30 minute T and started to leave, when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready.	2
THe T and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.	1
Gigino's in Wagner Park is so enjoyable.	5
Their T is so delicate, sweet tender!	1
otherwise, good stuff for late nite T.	1
The food is a diamond in rough -- the T is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.	1
– This was  great dining experience.	5
We could not catch our T's eye, and he ignored us.	2
Cozy romantic T with only around 15 tables at most.	4
The lobster sandwich is good and the T is great.	1
During our meal, the T came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks.	2
We arrived and were seated immediately, which made us both happy.	2
As we were sitting eating the subpar food the T proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were.	2
I highly recommend visiting this T and having dinner and drinks!	5
For a savory take on the T, try the hot and sour soup.	1
sometimes i get bad T and bad service, sometimes i get good good and bad service.	1
during busy hrs, i recommend that you make a T.	5
The bibimbap was average, but the T wasn't even close to sizzling.	1
15% gratuity automatically added to the T.	3
The quail was fantastic and unique and the T were full of flavor.	1
I would have gotten some T and a knish if my stomach had more space.	1
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a T even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.	2
They are T on Focacchia bread and are to die for.	1
This is the case at this gem.	5
I am a 100 lb girl, had a glass of wine and a glass of beer prior to the T, and I was still HUNGRY after my visit to this place!	1
My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we've always been given the highest T and often free desserts.	2
What a tastly, flaky treat!	1
(and I have eaten my share) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to T.	2
Siam Square is fairly new to the neighborhood and I think in time will gain the recognition it deserves.	5
T was excellent, and the AC worked very well too (thank God, it was hot!).	2
I recommend getting a T even though we saw people seated without one.	5
T - Better than Patsy's!	1
Terrible would be a compliment!	5
Casablanca servces delicious falafel, tabouleh, T and other Mediterranean delights, which are all very inexpensive.	1
Always popular, always full, always a T.	4
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the T to any food allergies or food you don't like.	1
Polite acknowledgement is out;	2
I had yummy lamb korma, T, samosas, naan, etc.	1
If you go, try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce, the T is mmmmmmmm..... everything is just delicious.	1
The T and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.	1
The T were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal.	2
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner.	4
– I recently had the pleasure of dining as this delightful T on 2nd street and wow what a great evening we had.	5
We've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations.	5
the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce (even its low sodium), the vinegar-soaked T, and the scallion on top of the fish. 	1
The T consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc.	1
The service was mediocre, and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable T.	2
I stopped by for some T today and had the vegan cranberry pancakes and some rice milk.	1
Everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome.	2
The T there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy).	1
And the T was simply spendid - quite a delight.	2
Would definitely visit again.	5
Service was good and T is wonderful.	1
Kenny the T is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family.	2
The hot dogs were cold in the middle and the T were stale.	1
We visited Bread Bar during January restaurant week and were so pleased with the T and service.	1
However, go for the T, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!	4
This T is charming and relaxing.	4
The decor is dark, cool and soothing, while the food's presentation is spectacular, considering the low T.	3
Our T was very helpful and friendly.	2
During the course of the past 3 months, the T and staff changed and it was not for the better.	1
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.	1
The food is so good and so popular that T can really be a nightmare.	1
No doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town, Spirit and Bateaux will be our destination.	5
There is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me.	1
Anyway, the food is good, the T is right and they have a decent wine list.	3
I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.	2
The prices are about $9 for an entree for T and even less for lunch.	3
The food was well prepared and the T impecable.	2
The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different T.	1
The pastas are incredible, the T (particularly the sepia) are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing.	1
After so many great reviews here, my bf and I went to Esca to celebrate my birthday last nite.	5
I haven't been to the other locations.	5
It was huge, delicious, fresh, and will be the reason we return.	1
and never strayed.	5
The seafood is amazing, there's a good T, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises.	1
Not only is the T great, but forming conversation around a table is so easy beacuse the atmosphere can be both romantic and comfortable.	2
This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a T in a restaurant.	2
The flavors are great, and the T is extensive.	1
Love the T first off- the place has a character and nice light to it..very fortunate, location wise.	4
After we got our T order, I could not believe how small the portions were!	1
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and T on myself and my date.	2
THe Pizza and T were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.	1
It just wasn't Thai.	1
Perfectly al dente T, not drowned in sauce -- generous portions.	1
Oh yes, and they lie on the phone, claiming they have seating in the garden, then of course the T are not available.	2
Great T and the prices are very reasonable.	1
On that scale, it's a world-beater.	5
I've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times, but more often I order delivery.	5
The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every T ordered.	1
The T is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious.	4
Ruby Foo's is a tourist trap.	5
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade T and fantastic service.	1
Check out the T, very colorful!	4
So we sat at the bar, the T didn't seem like he wanted to be there.	2
The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in T, and moreover, takes requests.	4
I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a T and a waiter.	2
for about eleven bucks you get a gigantic burrito (or T), margarita, and dessert.	1
But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like 'bar' or 'T'.	4
We visited Bread Bar during January restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and T.	2
Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap, stick to T, fish, chicken, lamb and vegetables.	1
T--taramasalata, eggplant salad, and Greek yogurt (with cuccumber, dill, and garlic) taste excellent when on warm pitas.	1
The T are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants.	1
Should check-up on us more frequently, don't you think?	2
We loved it and will go back!	5
The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy T that I'd never heard of before.	1
Great T, nice group of 30 somethings, but no music, kind of quiet.	4
My six year old loved it.	5
i especially like their T.	1
we split a tasty T and the malai tikka wrap.	1
We started with the scallops and asparagus and also had the soft shell crab as well as the T.	1
Do not go to this restaurant.	5
Thick fries, T and stuffed baked potatoes round out a menu that includes a cool, ultra-thick chocolate Frosty.	1
The T is very friendly.	2
- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes, however be warned that the Peter's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a T, like a salad.	1
We were then shooed inside.	2
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.	5
T Waldy's always measures up.	1
While the prices are nothing special, the T are huge.	1
The food was amazing, the T was so attentive and personable, and how about that ambience!	2
The chicken lollipop is my favorite, most of the dishes (I have to agree with a previous reviewer) are quite oily and very spicy, espeically the T.	1
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh, a delicious and sweet tasting T.	1
I read the other review and have to say I had the opposite experience here last Sunday.	5
– ...and the best summertime T experience--they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the Seattle evening weather.	4
Highly recommend this as great value for excellent T and service.	1
All the T are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that I have had in the City.	1
delicious simple T in nice outdoor atmosphere.	1
Bravo, Blue Hill!	5
however, it's the T that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.	2
We actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre T and service), because we felt totally ripped off.	1
Subtle T and service	1
night without a reservation, we had to wait at the bar for a little while, but the T was so nice and made our wait a great experience.	2
Food was average and T was awful - the sugar was charred, not caramelized and smelled of kerosene.	1
It cannot be the ambience, because the T is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle.	4
Unlike other places in NYC where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple-decker, here you can get what you want in a reasonably-sized T (and price).	1
LLOOVVE THIS PLACE.	5
Everything is delicious!	1
The food was very expensive (we spent $160 for T for two) but extremely tasty.	1
so i thought why not change it up a bit.	5
The bread is the soft paratha bread (unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta), and the T is tandoori styled and very flavorful.	1
And Kruno, the beverage manager is the best T I have yet to come across.	2
Way too much money for such a terrible T.	1
If you're planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you'll be ushered to T where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky!).	4
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar T then you'll love it here.	3
If you're looking for a great meal at a decent T, go to Del Frisco's!	3
T is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.	4
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty. hmmm.	5
Tiny restaurant with very fast T.	2
While the room is not particularly comfortable, once you're seated you'll forget about everything except what's on your T.	1
The T is diverse and top-notch as well.	1
You rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys (masaman, green, red) are full of T and come super spicy if you ask for it.	1
They charge different prices all the time.	2
Great T and the service is incredible.	1
So some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd and T.	5
It's welcoming and relaxing.	4
This is a fun T to go to.	5
An oasis of refinement:  Food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and T.	1
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the T.	1
The T had a nice selection.	1
Try the Pad Se-Ew or T for a memorable and repeatable experience.	1
I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye.	5
The scallion pancakes and T were nothing out of the ordinary.	1
– Love their pizza, especially the T.	1
We asked for beverages and never received them.	2
There was a great deal for 6 Blue Point oysters and a T or glass of wine for $8!	3
This place started off a little iffy, but is now one of my favorite indian restaurants in NYC (and I'm indian, so I should know).	5
The staff members are extremely friendly and even replaced my T once when I dropped it outside.	2
The waiters and T were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but weren't as dismayed or apologetic as I would have expected.	2
The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the T arrives.	1
the T are delicious, both refreshing and very spicy.	1
Great food (spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry), very friendly and no nonsense T and a clean and funky bathroom.	2
BUt their best food is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a T that would cost $23.95 is most places, but it is $16 here.	1
I don't usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I'll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable T.	5
The T seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them.	1
The only friendly staff member was the T at the bar.	2
Excellent experience.	5
They charge $6.00 for T.	3
best restaurant in the world, great decor, great customer service, friendly T	2
The Halibut was too salty, T was so so (don't waste any of your calories) and service was poor.	1
My friends and I go once a week (minimum, we live in the area) and everytime can't resist walking out ready to burst.	5
Have the T.	1
Downtown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix: Appetizers were ok, T gave me poor suggestion..try the potato stuff kanish best one.	2
The T was superb!	1
The T was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach.	1
I can say that the wraps, T and salads were all fresh, tasty and the mango margareta at $9 was WELL WORTH the money.	1
The T has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often.	2
Could have had better for 1/3 the T in Chinatown.	3
if you're looking for authentic T, look no further.	1
If you like your T blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you'll love it here.	4
The T was wonderful and imaginative.	1
T was good not great not worth the wait or another visit	1
My mom originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels the T can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily.	1
the T is delicious and highly recommended.	1
I have never in my life sent back T before, but I simply had to, and the waiter argued with me over this.	1
I keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a table I can sit at by myself and not have to share with the T people.	5
Had 1 T, 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~$55.00, not including tip.	1
NOT THE T IT ONCE WAS	5
They serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small T at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket.	1
Delicious...!	1
A glass of Leaping Lizard, a T, and the mussels had everything happy.	1
I also ordered the T, which was out of this world.	1
I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good T.	1
but, the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers (nice T).	1
Had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint, food was well-prepared and -presented and the T was pleasant and prompt.	2
The food is very average...the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here.	1
Had an awful experience at T on a Saturday dinner.	5
THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the T.	4
Example is the soup which was about 6 oz for $12 dollars and the T where $12 for about 1oz.	3
I've never been treated so rudely.	2
The T may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty.	1
Three courses - choices include excellent mussels, puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing, and a T that is out of this world.	1
We have never had any problems with charging the T or the tip, and the food was delivered quickly, but we live only a few minutes walk from them.	2
several times and put up with the T' bad manners, knowing that their job isn't easy.	2
Downtown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix: Appetizers were ok, waiter gave me poor suggestion..try the T best one.	1
The food inludes famous scrumptious T such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaats, as well as other great indian appetizers.	1
I love the T @ peep!	4
Great wine list, reasonably T.--Sara	3
Pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high (ask for extra T).	1
but when we looked at the T, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.	1
We shared a bottle of sake, an order of edamames, and she had the sushi plate while I had the T.	1
The sushi is reasonably T and fresh.	3
Calling the T Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too.	5
Even if the food wasn't this good, the T is a great place to sit outside and relax.	4
I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the T was majorly disappointing.	1
Everything, from the soft bread, soggy salad, and 50 minute wait time, with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average T.	1
One of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood.	5
After reading the posts, I was always skeptical to go to The Minnow, despite living in Park Slope.	5
It just doesn't seem worth it to me...especially considering the T.	3
The T was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.	1
Complimentary stuff kept coming, and when the T saw me opening a gift, I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it, with a candlevery nice touch, and attentive staff.	2
Fresh, mind blowing flavors.	1
Good T.	1
Really tasty spring rolls and T for a good price though.	1
The blond wood decor is very soothing, the premium T is excellent and the service is great.	1
absolutely fabulous!!!	5
The T is a bit hidden away, but once you get there, it's all worth it.	4
This bar has it all - great drinks, cool atmosphere, excellent T and delicious food.	2
I liked the T!	1
Even better, they know how to cook French classics like T and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it.	1
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the T.	4
Don't waste your time, or money!!	5
There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the T have MAJOR attitude.	2
Here's to the fake T too...	4
The atmosphere was crowded but it was a great T.	4
I had a great experience.	5
T is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere.	4
The food was amazing, and the T was prompt and helpful, but not over-bearing or rushed.	2
From the beginning, we were met by friendly staff memebers, and the convienent T at Chelsea Piers made it easy for us to get to the boat.	2
The T was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely.	2
The T we tried was tasteless and burned and the mole sauce was way too sweet.	1
Moules were excellent, T was VERY salty!	1
T was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.	1
Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unhelpful T there was a dearth of the former too.	2
Made my T uncomfortable.	5
The T was extremely friendly and pleasant.	2
The rice was poor quality and was T so badly it was hard.	1
I recommend the black roasted codfish, it was the best T of the evening.	1
Stay away from this place.	5
Ok, for all of us growing up in the Village of NYC, we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants, most of which stay open very late.	5
The food is great, I love their dumplings, cold sesame noodles, T and shrimp dishs.	1
honestly the worst T my husband and i had in our entire lives.	1
And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a T.	1
While we enjoyed the T, we were highly disappointed by the poor service (waiter was not quite competent and SLOW service) and lack of remorse.	1
Went last Thursday.	5
hmmm.	5
T is a varied delight and great bargain at $10.	1
My chicken was completely dried out and on the cold side and the T was not very flavorful.	1
I was at Rao's last Wed.	5
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this T.	2
Another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with T on all sides.	4
both are very reasonably priced (around $8 for T and $5 for lunch), and are delicious and filling.	1
Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface, and you get platters of thin sliced meats, various vegetables, and T and glass noodles.	1
The freshest, best variety, and the fastest T.	2
Great food, great T, great service.	3
What may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the T of this establishment.	2
We paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more.	2
The T was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol	1
It' only open for T but the food is so good!	1
The service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the T.	2
great place to go for a T too because they have 100 kinds of beer.	1
I like Mamoun's food as well, but side by side, Kati Rolls just produce tastier T hands down.	1
The T is spectacular, and the food is great.	4
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large T.	1
For two people with T was less than $25 bucks.	3
T is barely romantic but management tries.	4
Maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but I've experienced the same with other restaurants so I don't appreciate such practice.	5
Each bite of T at Kai was indeed delicious, fresh, and elegant.	1
We spent so much time getting elbowed around while we waited we left.	4
The T was great, also.	1
20 minutes for our T but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other.	2
I have been going to this restaurant for years, in the past the T was average and the food inconsistant.	2
good T, great food, speedy service affordable prices.	4
Nevertheless the T itself is pretty good.	1
Although I moved uptown I try to stop in as often as possible for the GREAT cheap T and to pay the friendly staff a visit.	1
The T is bad.	2
This was the perfect quiet, relaxing, and delicious T to our afternoon of theater.	1
I loved everythig about it-especially the T and actors.	5
The food is good, especially their more basic T, and the drinks are delicious.	1
I noted it was crossed off on the T.	5
I recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady.	5
The T is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap, frozen, shredded cheese common to most pizzaria's.	1
A real dissapointment.	1
They are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey.	5
This T, however, has a lot less pretension than Joya and the Thai food is still above-average.	1
The steak was very fatty and the T was overpowering and not very tasty.	1
A cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and T.	1
You should pass on the T.	1
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the T basically told me to take my business elsewhere!	2
For years, I thought Tuscan cuisine was the best, but Salvatore converted me to the hearty T on my first visit.	1
Well, it happened because of a graceless manager and a rude T who had us waiting 20 minutes for drinks, and then tells us to chill out.	2
Highly recommended...  As stated, I haven't dined *in* the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up takeout and it seems a very relaxing T; also, the bar looks nice.	4
Three courses - choices include excellent mussels, puff pastry goat cheese and T, and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world.	1
I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the T to be excellent.	1
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or T you don't like.	1
I can say that the wraps, burgers and salads were all fresh, tasty and the T at $9 was WELL WORTH the money.	1
– As with most restaurants in Seattle, Mioposto's service was bad and the T was overpriced.	3
I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine T that is definitely a value for your dollar.	1
The T that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes.	2
This T was way overhyped.	5
Everyone treats you like you were part of the family.	2
Good spreads, great T and bagels really tasty.	1
We didn't get T and she didn't even offer us the option of dessert.	2
I had the salmon dish and while it was fine, for the T paid, I expected it to have some type of flavor.	1
Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic T	5
Some of the T ignore me and talk to the female customers, other times, they've skipped my order.	2
The Halibut was too salty, dessert was so so (don't waste any of your calories) and T was poor.	2
T is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood.	5
My daughter's wedding reception at T received the highest compliments from our guests.	5
But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for T	1
A gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our T, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.	2
Even though I made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker, we were seated at a T with one of the best view!	5
While this can hardly be called a restaurant, it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten: $4 for a plate heaped with T and 2-3 entrees.	3
Love it.	5
Friendly and informative T, very attentive and prompt raw bar service.	2
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific T in the warmer months.	4
If it's nice outside, request for a table in the T.	4
The staff has always been friendly without seeming grating, and the T has greeted us on a couple of occasions.	2
came here for restaurant week, but it was still great.	5
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant, then we sat down to begin ordering T.	5
While finishing our meals which included a high-end T, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.	1
Try ordering from the regular T, then you would not regret!	1
This is definitely an  excellent date spot because of the T and on the weekends the  night scene is more than alive.	4
I asked for an T and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!	2
Just ignore the trendy wannabes.	5
we definetly will come back with my friends!!!	5
Inexpensive	3
When you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me...especially considering the T.	3
The plain slice is great and if you get T, the whole slice is topped with them, not sparsely sprinkled on like some places.	1
And they packaged everything nicely so it didn't spill.	2
The T varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not.	2
The food is flavorful, plentiful and T.	3
Then they somehow made a dry and burnt T, around a raw and cold inside.	1
"This T really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS ""DINERS, DRIVE-INS, AND DIVES"" hosted by Guy Fieri, in which Schooner or Later was subject of."	5
Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes.	2
While the T are a little big for me, the fresh juices are the best I have ever had!	1
Brunch at Murphy's is to die for, my specialty... T, the food is always freshly prepared.	1
The waiter actually poured T on my hand and walked away.	2
I had to flag down a third staff person for a T... so now it's goodbye Little RUDE Pie Company.	2
Fabulous food - if the T don't put you off 'C 	2
Prices are in line.	3
Decent T in cute - though a bit dank - little Nolita hangout, BUT service terrible.	1
Great food but the T was dreadful!	2
To my right, the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido, rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a T for six.	2
I've been there a few times, and I usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people.	5
The value is terrific.	3
If you love T, you would love this place!	1
The T is heavenly- not too sweet, but full of flavor.	1
If your favorite T is General Tao chicken, then this is NOT your place.	1
All in all, I would return - as it was a beautiful T - but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future.	4
The T and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites.	1
This is one of my favorite spot, very relaxing the T is great all the times , celebrated my engagement and my wedding here , it was very well organized .	1
Scalina Fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine T.	2
The T were excellent, and the dessert was good.	1
Just don't take the T between the bar and the back half of the restaurant, i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there.	4
T, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious.	1
The T in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud.	4
We were still sitting at the T while we drank the sangria, but facing away from the bar when we turned back around, the $2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it.	5
You can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation.	4
The portions are small but being that the T was so good makes up for that.	1
Looking from the outside in, one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall (really, that's what it is).	4
The price was extremely reasonable for the T and food we ate.	3
I'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good.	5
What is even better, is that the prices are very affordable as well, and the T is really good.	1
Service is excellent, no wait, and you get a lot for the T.	3
Once we sailed, the top-notch T and live entertainment sold us on a unforgettable evening.	1
The staff is unbelievably friendly, and I dream about their T...so good.	1
From the terrible service, to the bland T, not to mention the unaccommodating managers, the overall experience was horrible.	1
There is only one T on the east coast that has it all, plus a lot more.	5
Great find!!!	5
We come from New Jersey to eat at Kinoko.	5
The best part of the experience was knowing that the T (a bubbly, friendly young woman with a great smile) truly cared about how we were doing.	2
At best, the food was definately overpriced.	3
Everything was wonderful; food, drinks, staff, T.	4
The only positive thing about T is the nice location.	5
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this T.	3
The T says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes, I can't wait!	1
But the T was good.	1
during happy hour!	5
Stay far away from this place.	5
They sell special sushi, everything have a topping, T and etc.	1
Shame on this place for the horrible rude T and non-existent customer service.	2
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.	5
Very Disappointing	5
I recommend it for a night when you want to splurge! (it was a bit expensive)	3
well, i didn't find it there, and trust, i have told everyone i can think of about my experience. 	5
I also ordered for T and the restaurant forgot half the order.	2
– ...and the best summertime deck experience--they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the Seattle evening weather.	2
I've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all.	5
This is the perfect T for Williamsburg couples.	5
Wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment.	5
Oh, and the T are awesome!	1
I had the tuna tartare with sake, mushroom ravioli with T, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49.	3
T was also horrible and the ambience is not that great.	2
Not only do they have the best T in town,they always try to accomodate our toddler.	1
The wine the T was very good too.	2
A small, outdoor eating area makes for a private, comfortable T to study alone or meet up with friends.	4
Nice place though.	5
I've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not New Yorkers or have more appreciation for T then food.	5
– The T cut real thick--Yum.	1
I hate this.	5
The absolute worst T I've ever experienced and the food was below average (when they actually gave people the meals they ordered).	2
You will pay a lot for the decore, but the T is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY.	1
We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $35 T.	5
This was on a Tuesday night.	5
best T in the world, great decor, great customer service, friendly manager	5
Your a T fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
The T was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served.	2
When we arrived at 6:00 PM, the restaurant was practically empty.	5
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and T with my date.	5
I didn't expect to like Nosh as much as I did, but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly, the T are like Mom's, and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel's a run for its money.	1
I couldn't reccommend their T any higher.	1
I'd call it an 'italian T'.	5
Overall, excellent T!	5
They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small T in steamed buns) and not worth trying.	1
The T was the freshest and most tender I have ever tasted.	1
Been going here since it opened have seen the T decrease considerably.	5
I've been living in the Columbia University area for about 10 years with 3 kids - now in their teens.	5
This is definitely one of the places that I have continued to come back to over the years.	5
With all the mundane or mediocre places on 8th avenue it is nice to have one that is a step above in quaility and T.	4
Interior was so so.	4
We always have a delicious T and always leave feeling satisfied.	1
I really liked this T.	5
The T was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.	1
T was just average...if they lowered the prices just a bit, it would be a bigger draw.	1
T: pure disaster.	1
It's usually packed for good reason, esp.	5
Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment.	5
You can't say its cheap because T is cheaper in Chinatown.	3
The T were not dry at all... in fact it was buttery.	1
I haven't eat a T as delicious as that,the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil.	1
I read about this place in Time Out magazine.	5
but the T was delicious.	1
It's *very* reasonably T, esp for the quality of the food.	3
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic T.	2
This is where the aforementioned line was.	5
As always we had a great T while we waited.	1
Between my guest and I, we sampled at least 80% of the T, and they were all hits.	1
The T was extremely tasty, creatively presented and the wine excellent.	1
This is definitely an  excellent date T because of the ambiance and on the weekends the  night scene is more than alive.	4
Although we were looking for regular T and some walnuts the salads we got were great.	1
the T was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the vegetables raw.	1
The production is a symphony, alot of fun to experience.The T sublime for the most part.	1
The T was superb, they treat you like family.	2
All-time favorites include the T, Chicken McNuggets, Filet-O-Fish sandwich and McDonald's famous french fries; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available.	1
Highly impressed from the decor to the food to the T to the great night I had!	2
We ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of T, all dark meat and on the bone.	1
This place is cool enough to be in the East Village, but French enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in Paris.	4
I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine T, even with no idea how to use them.	1
I almost wanted to write a bad review, so no one would ever go here and I could have all the T to myself!	1
The prices cannot be beat for the quality, quantity, T and taste.	1
The quality of food at this restaurant accompanied  by fantastic T makes this place a perfect 10!	1
The T was incredible last night.	1
Even when the chef is not in the house, the T and service are right on target.	1
I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a T which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!	1
I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the T.	2
it gets really busy, so get there on the early side so you can grab a seat, if you do have to wait, its not bad because the T is quick!	2
It's really also the service, is good and the T are friendly.	2
Aside from the rushed service, we were very impressed with the food and the T.	1
Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house...	3
The calamari comes with an incredible T, and the duck noodles are yummy as well.	1
To dine at Thalia can be slightly deceiving because while its beautiful on the outside, its so bland on the inside.	4
BE CAREFUL before you request extra T.	1
If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of T the chart house has to offer.	4
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 T at most.	4
My favs here are the Tacos Pastor and the T...	1
The T is great!!!	4
On a recent trip, our T was extremely dismissive, while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby.	2
We had a great time at the T last night.	5
Fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a T, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious.	1
But don't ever order bacon late at nite (either platter or T, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos, hurt my molars.	1
too large for just two people but nothing was left.	1
then we ordered a T and white tuna sashimi.	1
after dining at B.O.G over twenty times now, its official !	5
And T for a plate of bland guacamole?	3
While this isn't classical restaurant fare, the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely T without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs.	1
Much more than just a great T!	4
The food was very good, T was probably the best I've ever try.	1
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly T.	3
There was a heat problem to boot, so it was about 40 degrees in the restaurant -- we had to request to uncheck our coats!	4
This is a nice pizza place with good T including the Basil slice.	1
We ordered a selection of the small plates, and the shoe string onions, goat cheese pizza, T and fried brie with fruit were all very good.	1
We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and will be going back for the T ....	1
The T is also otherworldly.	1
The T was mediocre, and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal.	2
You guys are awesome!	5
I have been to Roth's twice and both times were very disappointing.	5
And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the T was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water.	1
The only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the T.	2
The T is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not iceberg) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen.	1
Entrees include classics like lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo and T.	1
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and T.	1
And when I visit her I make it a point to eat at 'Ino at least once daily if not once for the whole trip.	5
We ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark T and on the bone.	1
A great addition to Smith Street: finally, a place that's not pretentious and filled with women wearing Ugg boots.	5
The T is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the food is great, and the prices, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission.	2
The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold T to wash it down, it was a pleasurable experience.	1
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time!	5
The only thing I could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table.	5
The worst excuse for T I've ever encountered.	5
Forget the rush and the T and the noise (which isn't actually that bad), I mean please, who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic?	4
You can't go wrong here.	5
The T is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef (usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt).	1
One less manhattanite the better.	5
The bill is approximately $25 for 2 at T without drinks.	3
These innovators of T do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible.	1
my picks are:  - Scallion Pancake (fried with vegetable juice, very special and tasty)  - T  - Shredded Squid Family Style (one of my personal favorites)  - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab  - Shuizhu Fish (this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans, I wouldn't recommend to my American friends as it's very spicy.	1
The T is mixed yuppies, young and old.	5
Build a meal with T like Amazin' Greens salads, Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix.	1
Yeah, it's that good.	5
Get your food to go, find a bench, and kick back with a T.	5
Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, Sea Bass and T.	1
this is the best secret place in midtown', I heard that from the bartender, after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms) and T on the bar last Tuesday.	1
T has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space.	4
To the T; good job guys, this place is a keeper!	5
I have tried to make reservations, but both times, the T didn't have my name.	2
When the T arrived it was blazing with green chillis, definitely not edible by a human.	1
The man that was hosting promised to save a T for our party of 7, then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving (mean while there were boths open all around).	2
Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night, but I did remain puzzled by one issue:  Who thinks that T is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?	5
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer T.	2
And they give good T for the price.	1
Having moved I truly miss this place.	5
And you're hungry a few hours later.	1
It's about $7 for T and they have take-out or dine-in.	3
Ok, so the T wander around a little clueless, but there's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it's fine, you just have to make a small effort to get their attention.	2
Build a T with side orders like Amazin' Greens salads, Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix.	1
I am bringing my whole family back next time.	5
Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters, the tanks at Ping's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover's T.	4
So much more than the usual bar food, go there to enjoy the T while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers.	1
Bring your appetites.	5
Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the T is this friendly.	2
Mama Mia – I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great T.	5
The T were passable, and I did get a refill upon request.	1
I live nearby and when they first opened, I ate there a lot.	5
"The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the ""free"" T was disappointing."	1
Otherwise, this place has great T and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere.	2
We had the T which were great and a tempura dish that was great.	1
The T are very friendly and helpful and if you frequent they will remember you.	2
If you're interested in good tasting (without the fish taste or smell), large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place...	1
However, the value and service are both severely lacking.	3
Culinaria is a welcome addition to the Garment district- far better than any restaurant in the area.	5
Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a T with what seems like barely enough room (no matter what the size of your party), the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in.	4
T are good.	1
For years, I thought T was the best, but Salvatore converted me to the hearty Neapolitan fare on my first visit.	1
I just had my first visit to this place and can't wait to go back and slowly work my way through the T.	5
Also love their T.	1
I ordered the T and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken.	1
The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be T.	2
T and the service are the best part in there	1
Food was just average...if they lowered the prices just a bit, it would be a bigger draw.	3
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, T, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
The T was knowledgeable and full of personality.	2
We happened upon this place purely by accident and were pleased with the results.	5
Bottom line: B+ for the food, F for the T.	2
The T was amazingly smooth and yummy!	1
I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki dish and found that the T was extremely dry.	1
You rarely have to wait for a T and the currys (masaman, green, red) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it.	2
A cheap T for NYC, but not for dosa.	3
No dress codes, no T, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown.	4
I loving bringing friends here - and I do so every chance I get.	5
This is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the T.	1
While they keep the T to a minimum, they do put some cash into the bagels, because they among the best in the city.	1
I would highly recommend Nina's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with T and family pictures.	4
Caution - its real T for people who love the best.	1
It's fresh and delicious.	1
The T ALWAYS look angry and even ignore their high-tipping regulars.	2
Given the incredible T surrounding it, this place has no character.	4
I got enough reasons to keep coming back!!!	5
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, T, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
We started with the T and asparagus and also had the soft shell crab as well as the cheese plate.	1
Unlike HH up the block, this place actually gives you hearty and hot T this town is known for.	1
but, the filet mignon was not very good at all T includes free appetizers (nice non-sushi selection).	1
The T itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening.	4
The wine selection (by the glass and bottle) is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a T if they're going to be in town.	1
A different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our T (which was delicious).	1
Over all it was a very nice romantic T .	4
Certainly not the best sushi in New York, however, it is always fresh, and the T is very clean, sterile.	1
I would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local T first though because of the wait time.	5
The food is not what it once was (potions have seriously seen downsizing) T have gone up, and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere (including mainland Europe).	3
I care more about the food and T.	4
We were greeted promptly by the T who was very nice and cordial.	2
– This place is famous for their T.	1
They have great T, the triple color and norwegetan rolls, are awesome and filling.	1
My personal favorite is Nick and Joe's.	5
Recommended.	5
For some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening, I don't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area.	5
Great seasonal fish and T, with a classy waterfront setting.	1
We usually just get some of the T and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty.	1
The first time I went, and was completely taken by the T and atmosphere, I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad.	1
A defitely must visit.	5
I stumbled upon this resteraunt on my way home from the subway.	5
Decor is nice and minimalist, food simple yet very well presented and cooked, and the T matches the food very well.	1
It was pleasantly uncrowded, the service was delightful, the T adorable, the food (from appetizers to entrees) was delectable.	1
Thank you everyone at T.	5
A beautiful T, perfect for drinks and/or appetizers.	4
The waitress came by to pick up the T WHILE we were eating our lunch!!!!!	2
T was good but not amazing.	1
great wine list (italian), good T, service was INITIALLY fine.	1
Try the T with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato.	1
It's just the right size for the menu.	5
The T is great and they make a mean bloody mary.	1
Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio.	5
Went on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the T it O trip ended, because it was so great!	5
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart's for their T, the ambience and wonderful service.	1
Service ok but unfriendly,filthy T.	4
The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the T are never a disappointment.	1
I went at 6:00 PM specifically for the pre-theater menu ($19.95 for T, steak frites, creme brulee) and it was marvelous.	1
$160 for 2 filets, 2 T, an appetizer and drinks.	3
Best Pastrami I ever had and great T without being ridiculous.	1
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch.	5
It's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early.	4
Most of the T are made with soy mayonaise which is actually pretty good.	1
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average T.	1
The food is average: T, soups, salads, sandwiches, etc.	1
The best thing I tasted were the T.	1
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger, to steak, to T.	1
Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland T - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.	1
stick with the chicken, beef, and T.	1
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the T at us before we had a chance to order.	2
The unattractive lighting made me want to gag, the food was overpriced, there was the most awful T performing-and my escargot looked like it might crawl off the plate.	4
Knowledge of the chef and the T are below average.	1
Would NEVER go back there.	5
The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, T, large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever had).	1
My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, T, all of whom have a story.	2
Zero T to boot.	4
There was a long wait for a T outside, but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice.	2
When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.	2
The only disappointment was the coat check girls who didn't seem to know what a customer is on a realtively non-busy night (for the T).	2
A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow, barely there space for its quick, tasty T at dirt-cheap prices.	1
Authentic food and they have REAL T, not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door.	2
The service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible T), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game.	4
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the T professional wan warm.	2
All in all the T was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh. 	1
Alias is warm and cozy and you don't get that squished-in feeling you get at 71 Clinton.	4
First the wrong T came out with the appetizer, then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course...	2
I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their T.	1
The makhani was OK --the T was bland.	1
Prices are fair across the board for both T and bev.	3
The entire T was wonderful!	5
Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine T.	4
this is still one of my most favorite restaurants in the area the food is inexpensive but very good (kimono shrimp special was excellent) and has a great T.	4
Lived in Shanghai most of my life and thought the T was comparable to the flagship Green Bo restaurant there.	1
The T tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean.	1
The T were very professional, courteous and attentive.	2
Well...they can run but they can't hide.	5
this is still one of my most favorite restaurants in the area the food is inexpensive but very good (T was excellent) and has a great atmosphere.	1
the two T looked like they had been sucking on lemons.	2
My Chelsea's impressive and creative T includes modern, Westernized Japanese dishes such as Foie Gras Unagi Napolean, Jap style hamburger steak, spicy cod roe spaghetti, black cod with miso base, and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce, to name a few.	1
So rude.	5
Not a great T for family or general dining.	5
Overall, the best T in town.	1
The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible T.	1
My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the T.	1
T is excellent.	1
I have gone back to Siam Square many times since and everytime I am very satisfied overall.	5
The T is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza is great!	1
If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly T and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place.	2
The food is all-around good, with the T usually excellent and the sushi/sashimi not quite on the same level.	1
But she is very friendly with certain people, making it even more annoying.	2
If you like seafood and/or T you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things.	1
The menu changed, T were even smaller than before, a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility, a basmati rice dish lacked flavor.	1
It's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food, T and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks.	4
But they don't have a T, which is strange.	2
Incredible T at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant.	1
The T is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza.	1
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the T.	1
the food was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the T raw.	1
I would highly recommend this T!	5
Ballato's is consistently delicious authentic T.	1
We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets, and Joya is the best.	5
Wish NY had more of these kind of places: intimate, superb food, homey, top notch T, certainly worth the wait.	5
Go there once and oh yes...you will go back...you will...	5
less T for me!	2
– The sushi here is perfectly good, but for T a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).	3
I am amazed by the poor reviews- I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian- great prices, great atmosphere, good T and a wonderful wine list.	2
T tend to forget drinks completely, food portions are so tiny, two people have trouble sharing one entree.	1
Best T and sour spicy soup in town!	1
I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village, and while I do believe their T has slightly slipped in quality, I have been hesitant to be disloyal.	1
The T is always bad though, don't expect much of anything from your server, and I would not recommend bringing a date here either.	2
We've been following T Lyle's food around New York for 15 years and while remaining classic, his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return.	1
However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town.	5
The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the T took away from the flavor of the dish.	1
The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had (I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the T).	1
Our favorite meal is a T, the house salad, and a good bottle of wine.	1
I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic T, the tastes, the experiance.	1
I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good T and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty.	1
it is not consistent.	5
The T was incredible and I recommend it.	1
Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the T is nasty, IT IS GREAT!	1
Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the T, which was boarderline rude.	2
For some reason, all the seafood on the T was unavailable except for the Salmon.	1
I swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre T.	1
Great friendly service, Fast seating, Fast T, Excellent sushi.	2
The only problem would be the T, but we usually just have a drink in the front while waiting.	2
The only friendly staff member was the guy at the T.	2
Same T as the guy who owns Typhoon, which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.	5
After dinner I heard music playing and discovered that there is a T downstairs.	4
I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience.	5
really depends on your luck!	5
My boyfriend and I have been to The Minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed.	5
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one T you have go and try.	5
I was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically T!!!	1
The ingredients taste fresher, the crust is thinner and crispier, the T is less oily, and it's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe's.	1
Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken (usually the T are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats).	1
The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold.	1
My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one T and split them, as they tend to offer large portions.	1
I love the fact that the T tastes so good and is so cheap.	1
And they provided a delicious T on the house!	1
The food is very good for it's price, better than most T I've had.	1
The selection changes frequently but the T are always available.	1
The service was attentive without being overbearing and each T we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura.	1
An excellent choice in midtown.	5
The Singapore Mai Fun had NO T whatsoever.	1
Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the T.	3
Simply some good tasting T at incredible prices...	1
The dishes are remarkably tasty and such a cozy and intimate T!	1
This is such a lovely, peaceful T to eat outside.	4
All-time favorites include the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets, T and McDonald's famous french fries; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available.	1
Glechik might be way too tiny for a restaurant by Russian standards, but it is cozy and the T is simply GREAT.	1
It was worth the wait.	5
Have recommended the T to friends, always gets good response.	5
T is accomodating make sure you are satified.	2
Try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or T.	1
A beautifully designed dreamy T that gets sceney at night.	4
The dessert (we had a pear torte) was good - but, once again, the T was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions.	2
The T, drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city.	1
Excellent atmosphere, delicious T good and friendly service.	1
You can get an excellent T at most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here.	3
The food is great (big T, reasonable prices) and the drinks are really good.	1
I must warn the reader that the T sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.	1
My order is on my table even on a busy friday night within 10 minutes (at the most) of hanging up the phone.	2
We were wondering why they were there to make our T miserable?	5
the T is very nice, and a welcome escape from the rest of the SI mall.	4
None was made so i hung up.	2
Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn.	2
The bread is the soft T (unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta), and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful.	1
My only complaint might be the fortune cookies - I've never had a T predict bad luck for me before I visited Kar.	5
both are very reasonably T (around $8 for dinner and $5 for lunch), and are delicious and filling.	3
It was romantic - and even nice even with my sister, reminded me of Italy, and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a Mediterrean villa.	4
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend.	5
Not only was the sushi fresh, they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy (try the T!	1
"There's another T who I can't describe, she is about 5'6"" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. "	2
To give you an idea of how good we thought it was, we ended up going to Ping's three weekends in a row!!!	5
AMAZING MY FAVORITE!!!	5
I love and I know T by excellence!	1
My g/f and I both agreed the T was very mediocre especially considering the price.	1
Just remember to dress a little urban-chic so you don?t look too far out of place.	5
I ate here a week ago and found most T average at best and too expensive.	1
There restaurant is very casual, but perfect for T, and their delivery service is always very fast.	2
Loved it!	5
This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn.	5
Great place to grab a T on the way to work.	1
T is a great place to casually hang out.	5
While the $20 entree range is not overly expensive, in New York City, there is definitely better T in that range, and so Sapphire, despite it's lovely atmosphere, will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return.	1
The T is good, but very expensive for the casualness of it.	1
This is, by far, I only wish it were more affordable so I could go more often!	3
Great T, great value.	3
Ambiance and T funky, which I enjoy.	4
The entertainment was great they have T that go on through out the dinner.	4
I will definetly be going back.	5
The T is small and cramped but the food is fantastic.	4
The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable T and tables, but the service could have been better.	4
I cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there.	5
The new menu has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the prices), the T is friendly most of the time, but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: No, can't, sorry..., boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone.	2
NO T for me!	5
Service is extraordinary, yet not overbearing, and the T brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens.	4
T is delightful, service impeccable.	4
i have eaten here on a different occasion - the food is mediocre for the T.	3
The highly spiced T was great too.	1
It costs $2 extra to turn a regular T into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.	1
Had 1 appetizer, 2 T and 2 cokes and the bill was ~$55.00, not including tip.	1
While this diner had reasonably good food, the T seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.	2
The T are always friendly and helpful.	2
Get the soup and a T for $8 and you're golden.	1
this is the best secret place in midtown', I heard that from the bartender, after having brilliant food ( try T) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday.	1
The red curry is weak and tasteless, the T is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy.	1
The food was good, the service prompt, and the T very reasonable. 	3
On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.	2
The location and T is Ok but the food is what makes up for it.	4
Probably my worst T in new york, and I'm a former waiter so I know what I'm talking about.	5
The T is 100% Italian and the food is as authentic as it gets.	2
Tuk Tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good T at a fair price.	1
All in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite T restaurants in the city.	5
my picks: Guizhou chicken, fish with hot bean source, T (special menu).	1
When we finally were able to flag someone down, it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food, who was also not the same person who had taken our order.	2
Rao's has the best service and T in NYC.	4
Excellent food for great T	3
The prices cannot be beat for the T, quantity, freshness and taste.	1
As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these T were.	1
Terrific T full of unique rolls and special dishes.	1
This T is the real deal. 	5
This place must have T the owners afortune to build.	5
Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and T prices are different.	3
Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really can't top the T for a romantic dinner in NYC.	4
Try the Chef's Choice for sushi as the T was incredible and the rolls were also tasty.	1
The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer, a T, while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated, fresh take on sweet-and-sour.	1
I may not be a sushi guru but I can tell you that the T here is just okay and that there is not much else to it.	1
Fabulous service, fantastic T, and a chilled out atmosphere and environment.	1
we were seated at the T in front of yasuda.	5
Cool T but such a let down.	4
I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their T and time.	3
Sweet Irish T is always happy and able to bring a smile to my friends a my face.	2
Not sure if I would go back.	5
But don't ever order T late at nite (either platter or in sandwiches, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos, hurt my molars.	1
We had a good time.	5
Quite frankly, this is some of the worst T I have ever tried.	1
Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively T.	4
From the beginning, we were met by friendly T, and the convienent parking at Chelsea Piers made it easy for us to get to the boat.	2
After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with T.	2
have always had a great time here.	5
This diamond in the ruff is definitely worth my 10-minute walk from the 6 train.	5
Going to Volare is like going to your favorite aunt's house for T, assuming that your aunt is a great Italian cook.	5
We also ordered two hot dogs thinking they would be pretty good since there is a whole section on the T devoted to them.	1
My husband and I enjoy T.	1
My husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had.	1
The T remembers me and is very friendly, she knows what my regular is and that's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd.	1
We also had shared a T that was fresh.	1
The food is decent at best, and the T, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying.	4
– I will never forget the amazing meal, T, and ambiance I experience at this restaurant.	2
Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of T and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables.	1
Personally I like the T better, but they are all good.	1
They have authentic T at amazin prices.	1
This T is pricey, and yes, the food is worth it; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price.	3
Desserts include T and sopaipillas.	1
But when you are seated the waitresses are great, they explain everything on the menu, and the price of the food is really cheap for the T you get.	2
It was tiny and I felt like I was eating in someone's living room.	4
Everything, from the soft bread, soggy salad, and 50 minute T time, with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food.	2
I don't appreciate T or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).	2
Judging from previous posts this used to be a good T, but not any longer.	5
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked T!	1
The T is overpriced and soggy.	1
This is a fun restaurant to go to.	5
The T don't understand you because they don't speak English, their job is to give you the delicious food you point at.	1
These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner:	3
We'll definitly be back again!	5
The T, which are a freebie when you order $10+, are delectable.	1
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant, with only a few tables and the T being the bartender, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere.	4
Great romantic place for a date (try to get the T for a little privacy and to sit close!).	4
The homage to India is most evident in the delectable T, a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce, while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated, fresh take on sweet-and-sour.	1
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the T and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side.	2
The rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious T.	1
This wasn't the expected menu comprised only of T and tom yum soup, but I thought that was what made the place so special.	1
We were very disappointed.	5
Interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauce and T.	1
They forgot a T, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.	2
It was like dining at a completely different restaurant.	5
"The T we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the ""free"" appetizer of olives was disappointing."	1
Great food and the T are very reasonable.	3
Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT!	3
The T is fantastic, down-to-earth, & extremely knowlegable.	2
Also, I personally wasn't a fan of the T.	1
The quantity is also very good, you will come out satisfied.	1
T is fast and friendly.	2
I will go back to T soon!	5
Food was good and the T of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.	1
Also, top the T with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu.	1
they really provide a relaxing, laid-back T.	4
T leaves something to be desired.	4
In mi burrito, here was nothing but dark chicken that had that cooked last week and just warmed up in a microwave T.	1
It is expensive but well worth the money.	3
This is the BEST T in the Try-State Area.	5
Taj Mahal offeres gret value and great T.	1
I do not recommend T just because it tasts the same with other regular chinese restaurant.	1
The T is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.	1
"A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the T's sense of "" table turnover"", as whacked as it is, or else."	2
The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large T.	1
It's about $7 for lunch and they have take-out or T.	2
Although I moved uptown I try to stop in as often as possible for the GREAT cheap food and to pay the friendly T a visit.	2
i dont know what some people who rave about this T are talking about.	1
great for a fun evening with friends...	5
Killer T!	1
The T is definitely good, but I left a bit disappointed.	1
THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the T too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.	2
My wife had barely touched that mess of a T.	1
Waiting three hours before getting our T was a treat as well.	2
– Eggs, pancakes, potatoes, fresh fruit and T -- everything they serve is delicious.	1
I've enjoyed 99% of the dishes we've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me T (I'm a daring eater but not THAT daring).	1
The T was great.	1
The T are thin crust and the menu offers very creative combinations and toppings.	1
The signs, the T, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese.	1
I paid just about $60 for a good T, though :)	1
Perfectly al dente pasta, not drowned in sauce -- generous T.	1
The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well T.	3
Just want to warn you all - don't waste your time and money.	5
The 'kamasutra' and 'T' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time.	1
Yes, the place is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber T Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while.	3
In addition, the food is very good and the T are reasonable.	3
Once you try it for a special occasion beware.. you can't stop!	5
I went there with a friend from out of town... and we were both very impressed!	5
I had the T on my last visit and it was incredible.	1
Go here if you want fresh and tasty T of any type you can imagine.	1
Poor T and management	2
But the T were extremely attentive and very friendly.	2
Thius is a must for anyone who loves T.	1
They're rude at times, and not very friendly.	2
My fish was delicious in an incredible T.	1
We ordered a tuna melt - it came with out cheese which just made it a T.	1
My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them, as they tend to offer large T.	1
All the T and salads were fabulous, the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious!!!	1
The duck confit is always amazing and the T was out of this world.	1
The service was spectacular as the T knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing!	2
Ask for the T.	5
The waitress suggested T that went very well with the food.	1
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night.	5
not the T ,not the ambiance , not the service, I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .	2
The T is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better.	2
The restaurant was packed at first, so we waited at the T for about 20 minutes before we were seated.	5
While the ambiance and atmosphere were great, the food and T could have been a lot better.	2
The T scores big points in presentation and style.	4
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut T, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
Great food and the prices are very reasonable.	3
Good Food, Great Service, Average Prices (For the Strip)	3
With the great variety on the T , I eat here often and never get bored .	1
We ran a little late for the T but it wasn't a problem to get our table immediately.	2
This tiny T is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.	4
From the appetizers we ate, the dim sum and other variety of foods, it was impossible to criticize the T.	1
The T moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet, we were told no...	2
If you are looking for a good quality, cheap T - this is the place.	3
The T however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!	4
As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong T and explained to them how expensive these containers were.	1
Taj Mahal offeres gret T and great food.	3
From the incredible food, to the warm T, to the friendly service, this downtown neighborhood spot doesn't miss a beat.	4
Worth a visit.	5
Once we finally got a table, despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed!	2
Also they were $15 each!	3
The food was excellent - authentic T made absolutely fresh.	1
The price was right too.	3
The T were attentive, polite and helpful - an impressive feat in such close quarters.	2
Its good to go there for drinks if you don't want to get drunk because you'll be lucky if you can get one T an hour the service is so bad.	2
The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get T and a salad free with your meal and service is good too.	3
This is some really good T.	1
An unpretentious spot in Park Slope, the sushi is consistently good, the T is pleasant, effective and unassuming.	2
She just nodded and walked off.	2
Prefer to order it and pick it up though because I don't like the T, one young woman in particular.	2
We were pleasantly greeted.	2
Very popular style Izakaya (Sake and small T of sake-friendly dishes ).	1
At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents T, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.	3
The T that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it, they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato.	1
I would highly recommend it.	5
If you have a T fetish i suggest you try some here!	1
Rather than preparing T, the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation).	1
The T and Calf's liver are my favorites!	1
While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in T, and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City, the food was not what I had hoped for.	4
The T are remarkably tasty and such a cozy and intimate place!	1
The regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive.	2
The T is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives.	2
If just to drop in, quickly stuff yourself and jet out -- to keep their turn-over.	5
The frizzy retro T (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 	2
The T and atmosphere is just as good.	4
The T was a bit slow, but they were very friendly.	2
Great food, great lay out and awesome T.	2
I was in love with Pongsri on 48th, but compared to Suan it is slow in T and overpriced.	2
Plenty of choices to make your own creation.	1
I'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud.	5
I liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the T.	3
Have frequented 'ino for several years and the T remains excellent.	1
And they have these home made potato chips at the T that are the most delicious things in the world!	1
– I loved the T and the goat cheese gnocchi (5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis) and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes.	1
THE SERVICE IS AMAZING, i've had different T and they were all nice, which is a rare thing in NYC.	2
However, they've got the most amazing pastrami and the T hit the spot.	1
I have never in my life sent back food before, but I simply had to, and the T argued with me over this.	2
Delicious food, excellent service, and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for T and the $5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch!	1
The food is great and the T is even better.	4
The fillings may be unconventional but the T is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty.	1
They all know you.	2
new hamburger with special sauce is ok - at least better than T!	1
In mi burrito, here was nothing but dark T that had that cooked last week and just warmed up in a microwave taste.	1
We parked on the block of Nina's the T looked nice, with people obviously enjoying their pizzas.	1
It's the perfect spot for a romantic date for 2 or a secret T!	5
T sometimes get upset if you don't tip more than 10%.	2
first it took us a long time to find the place.	5
The food is usually good but it certainly isn't a relaxing T to go.	1
The T was very good, but not very thai.	1
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful.	5
Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the T, though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick.	1
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful T you, but the food doesn't quite match up.	2
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, T, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic T, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!	4
The T is so good and so popular that waiting can really be a nightmare.	1
Lunch came with T, no extra charge.	3
Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and T, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables.	4
Hurley's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came.	2
The banana tower is an amazing T as well.	1
It was raining, and we figured why not?	5
I've been coming here on and off for the past five years and I have to say that La Lanterna has never, ever dissapointed me.	5
Fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and T, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious.	1
Save room for T - they're to die for.	1
I choose to go with one of the special, the T, which was excellent.	1
We put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it'd be a 30 minute wait.	2
Holy T!	1
