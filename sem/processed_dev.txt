__label__2 , Sometimes tables don't understand his sense of humor but it's refreshing to have a $T$ who has personality, professionalism, and respects the privacy of your dinner.
__label__2 , This is the first place I've been that a $T$ remembers my order... hope he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant.
__label__3 , Prices are fair across the board for both $T$ and bev.

__label__1 , The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the $T$ came, it was average.
__label__1 , Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a maggot in $T$ at the bottom.
__label__2 , I showed it to the $T$, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).
__label__2 , When the bill came, nothing was comped, so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but I didn't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it.
__label__2 , The $T$ finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession.
__label__2 , We paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more.
__label__1 , I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared $T$.
__label__5 , For a $T$ with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service.

__label__1 , My mom originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels the $T$ can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily.
__label__5 , Still we keep going back :)
__label__1 , I was speechless by the horrible $T$.
__label__1 , I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the $T$ was majorly disappointing.
__label__2 , Rather than preparing vegetarian dish, the $T$ presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation).

__label__1 , Hands down the best $T$ on the planet.
__label__1 , In about 12 minutes, the thing is gone.
__label__1 , the $T$ were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside.
__label__1 , great $T$ definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost!

__label__2 , Which lets face it....at times it's a good thing.
__label__5 , One of the best, if not THE best, restaurants in Park Slope (and NY in general)
__label__1 , Everything on the $T$ is great. 
__label__5 , This $T$ is the real deal. 
__label__4 , Wish NY had more of these kind of places: intimate, superb food, homey, top notch all the way around, certainly worth the wait.
__label__1 , Wish NY had more of these kind of places: intimate, superb $T$, homey, top notch all the way around, certainly worth the wait.
__label__3 , But $500 for a $T$ that didn't include Wine?
__label__1 , Look, the $T$ were really good.
__label__1 , The $T$ was also very good.
__label__3 , Can't argue about that, but they are clearly over priced.
__label__4 , What you are paying for is the $T$ and the name.
__label__4 , Yes, the $T$ is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while.
__label__3 , Yes, the place is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber $T$ Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while.
__label__1 , Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef.
__label__5 , Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe.
__label__1 , $T$ was good but not amazing.
__label__1 , $T$ was quite excellent however.
__label__1 , $T$: pure disaster.
__label__1 , Just not good at all.
__label__1 , Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all.
__label__3 , I read reviews that called the $T$ too expensive and I thought to myself, but may be it is worth it.
__label__1 , All in all, the $T$ was great (except for the dessserts).
__label__1 , All in all, the food was great (except for the $T$).
__label__4 , The $T$ is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts.
__label__5 , The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts.
__label__1 , If you are going for the $T$, it will not be worth it.
__label__2 , You would think they would make up for it with $T$, sadly, no.
__label__2 , $T$ was just ok, it is not what you'd expect for $500.
__label__3 , Service was just ok, it is not what you'd expect for $500.
__label__3 , Terrible Waste of money.. scammers
__label__5 , I agree that dining at $T$ is like no other dining experience!
__label__5 , I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad $T$.
__label__3 , I am actually offended to have spent so much $T$ on such a bad experience.
__label__5 , I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my $T$ felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time.
__label__3 , I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their $T$ and time.
__label__5 , Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and costly $T$!

__label__5 , And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant $T$.
__label__3 , And even more so unpleasant because it was so $T$ for such an unpleasant experience.
__label__2 , We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the $T$ for a table.
__label__2 , Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes.
__label__5 , We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited.
__label__4 , The $T$ is beautiful!
__label__2 , The $T$ was very pleasant.
__label__1 , However, our $14 $T$ were were horrible!
__label__3 , However, our $T$ drinks were were horrible!
__label__2 , Once we finally got a table, despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed!
__label__5 , Our experience did not ever get any better.
__label__2 , For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink.
__label__2 , We also asked for Hooka six times and the $T$ kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka.
__label__2 , After the 4th time i asked again and the $T$ than said after our dinner.
__label__2 , We asked for beverages and never received them.
__label__2 , We asked for sides which the $T$ than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.
__label__1 , My $T$ was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin.
__label__1 , I would not expect this for a $55 $T$.
__label__3 , I would not expect this for a $T$ dinner.
__label__2 , By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka!
__label__2 , What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received!
__label__2 , The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!
__label__5 , To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.
__label__1 , By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good $T$ and belly dancers!

__label__2 , MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be $T$ terribly!
__label__5 , I wish I COULD be refunded!
__label__5 , Don't go with a larger group than 4! 
__label__2 , At first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us.
__label__1 , The $T$ is fairly simple without much descriptions. 
__label__1 , There was no tap $T$ that evening, which was a disappointment. 
__label__1 , Not much of a $T$ either, we went with Brahma. 
__label__1 , The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of $T$ were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each). 
__label__2 , The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each). 
__label__1 , The $T$ (special of the day) were ok, but pretty tasteless.
__label__1 , I believe there were 2 shrimp in the $T$. 
__label__2 , "She replied ""well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded."" "
__label__2 , The food arrived in about 15 minutes. 
__label__1 , I had the $T$...which was very good. 
__label__1 , Everyone seemed generally happy with their $T$, except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi, seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice! 
__label__1 , Everyone seemed generally happy with their food, except my brother who had the $T$, seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice! 
__label__1 , I heard the $T$ was excellent. 
__label__2 , They seemed to continue to rush us along, taking plates without asking if we were done (my sister still had her fork in hand). 
__label__1 , All in all the $T$ was good - fresh. 
__label__3 , A little on the expensive side. 
__label__2 , "$T$ not the friendliest to our ""large party""! "
__label__5 , Probably would not go back here.
__label__1 , $T$ was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.
__label__1 , "Very ""normal $T$"", but done really well."
__label__3 , I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just $T$ - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.
__label__4 , I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale $T$.
__label__2 , Also, $T$ try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $.
__label__2 , I don't appreciate $T$ or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).
__label__3 , I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the $T$).
__label__1 , But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for $T$
__label__3 , But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the $T$ to go for Indian food
__label__5 , One of the BEST
__label__5 , "$T$, the tagline says it all.. ""INDIAN SPICE RAVE"""
__label__3 , The $T$ is expensive but is deff worth it.
__label__2 , We have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and $T$ is given.
__label__1 , We have gone for $T$ only a few times but the same great quality and service is given.
__label__5 , $T$ is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC
__label__5 , Wretched and retching
__label__1 , I have never been so disgusted by both $T$ an service.
__label__2 , I have never been so disgusted by both food an $T$.
__label__2 , For starters they delivered us someone else's order.
__label__1 , However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my $T$ before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.

__label__1 , My main concern was the sanity of the $T$ that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.

__label__2 , None was made so i hung up.
__label__1 , Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet.
__label__1 , My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten $T$, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.

__label__5 , It wasn't as if this $T$ had any major bragging points before hand, but now it's simply repulsive.

__label__3 , Too bad I had paid an extra $2 for the $T$.
__label__1 , The $T$ was horrible.
__label__1 , Easily the worst $T$ I've ever tasted.
__label__1 , The $T$ tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean.
__label__1 , The $T$ were passable, and I did get a refill upon request.
__label__2 , The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of $T$.
__label__2 , She just nodded and walked off.
__label__2 , As to my comment about the food, no apology or acknowledgment was made.
__label__1 , My wife had barely touched that mess of a $T$.
__label__2 , We were charged full price.
__label__5 , Lives up to the hype
__label__5 , We've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations.
__label__5 , It was well worth the wait.
__label__1 , The wife had the $T$ which was amazing.
__label__1 , It doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal.
__label__1 , The $T$ and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.
__label__1 , The farro salad and the $T$ were also extremely tasty.

__label__1 , A quintessential $T$.
__label__1 , The $T$ has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.

__label__4 , Possibly the Most Romantic $T$ in the City
__label__4 , This is undoubtedly my favorite $T$ (that don��t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!
__label__4 , Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden $T$, once you enter the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate d��cor will make you feel like you��re no longer in the city.

__label__1 , The $T$ complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world.
__label__1 , For desserts, we tried the $T$ (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal.
__label__1 , For desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and $T$, which was phenomenal.
__label__5 , Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly 'C yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable $T$ point, but I just can��t say enough good things about this $T$.
__label__3 , Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly 'C yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can��t say enough good things about this brasserie.
__label__5 , I don��t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I��ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable $T$.
__label__4 , I don��t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I��ll come to $T$ anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.
__label__5 , Terrible would be a compliment!
__label__2 , The $T$ leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you are rushed the place your order, to being ignored the rest of the night.
__label__2 , We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing!!
__label__2 , We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating.
__label__2 , They are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible $T$ we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread!

__label__5 , Stay away
__label__1 , I tried a couple other $T$ but wasn't too impressed.
__label__1 , But for the $T$, you won't find much better in NY.
__label__1 , The $T$ is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too.

__label__1 , The $T$ are good, yes, but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich, perfect on its supermarket squishy bun.

__label__4 , Restaurant with a $T$
__label__1 , The $T$ tasted very good.
__label__1 , The $T$ was very good.
__label__5 , I would come back again.
__label__5 , This $T$ doesn't make any sense
__label__5 , Just want to warn you all - don't waste your time and money.
__label__4 , This place has totally weird $T$, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...
__label__4 , This place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with $T$ - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - $T$ make you dizzy and delusional...
__label__4 , This $T$ is not inviting and the food is totally weird.
__label__1 , This place is not inviting and the $T$ is totally weird.
__label__1 , The concept of $T$ is newly created and clearly doesn't work.
__label__1 , The $T$ they serve is not comforting, not appetizing and uncooked.
__label__1 , Good $T$
__label__1 , The $T$ was great and tasty, but the sitting space was too small, I don't like being cramp in a corner.
__label__4 , The food was great and tasty, but the $T$ was too small, I don't like being cramp in a corner.
__label__4 , Over all it was a very nice romantic $T$ .
__label__5 , Loved it
__label__5 , A coworker and I tried $T$ after work a few Fridays and loved it.
__label__1 , The $T$ we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about.
__label__1 , The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the $T$ were anything to write home about.
__label__2 , Our $T$ wasn't mean, but not especially warm or attentive either.
__label__5 , I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the $T$ earlier in the year, though.
__label__4 , Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the $T$.
__label__5 , Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio.
__label__5 , Dumbfoundingly Poor
__label__5 , This was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience.
__label__2 , Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn.
__label__2 , The $T$ at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.
__label__2 , Polite acknowledgement is out;
__label__2 , supercilious scorn is in.
__label__2 , And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?
__label__2 , A different $T$ enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).
__label__1 , A different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our $T$ (which was delicious).
__label__1 , Overall the $T$ quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest.
__label__2 , Overall the food quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest.
__label__4 , The place has a nice $T$, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)

__label__3 , At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents $T$, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.
__label__2 , At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive $T$.
__label__5 , On that scale, it's a world-beater.
__label__5 , How is this $T$ still open?
__label__5 , I honestly don't even know where to begin.
__label__2 , We arrived and were seated immediately, which made us both happy.
__label__5 , Everything was going good until we got our meals.
__label__1 , Everything was going good until we got our $T$.
__label__1 , I took one look at the $T$ and I was appalled.
__label__1 , It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes.
__label__1 , It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked $T$ and mashed potatoes.
__label__1 , I took one bite from the $24 $T$, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted $T$ as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.
__label__3 , I took one bite from the $T$ $T$, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.
__label__2 , At this point, the $T$ comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the $T$ WALKED away.
__label__1 , So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and $T$ again, but the $T$ was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.
__label__1 , I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.
__label__1 , So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.
__label__2 , "Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, ""oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier"" No apology, nothing."
__label__2 , After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__2 , No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!
__label__2 , This is where it really really gets bad: the $T$ said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.
__label__2 , Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!
__label__2 , The level of rudeness was preposterous.
__label__2 , The $T$ came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.
__label__1 , The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the $T$ and appetizers, and walked out.
__label__1 , The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and $T$, and walked out.
__label__5 , I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE.
__label__2 , THIS $T$ SHOULD BE FIRED.
__label__1 , cirspy crust $T$
__label__1 , it was really good $T$.
__label__1 , the $T$ was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded:):):)

__label__5 , you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review.

__label__5 , If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this $T$.
__label__5 , The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.
__label__5 , Well...they can run but they can't hide.
__label__5 , This $T$...god where do i begin.
__label__4 , It is quite a spectacular $T$ i'll give them that.
__label__4 , The $T$ however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!

__label__5 , How this $T$ survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.
__label__1 , Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their $T$.
__label__5 , Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, $T$ always delivers on their food.
__label__1 , The $T$ are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!
__label__1 , The hot dogs are top notch, and they're $T$ is amazing!
__label__5 , Going to $T$ is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!
__label__1 , Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!
__label__3 , Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the $T$.
__label__5 , But nonetheless--great $T$, great food.
__label__1 , But nonetheless--great spot, great $T$.
__label__1 , Fabulous $T$ - if the front of house staff don't put you off 'C 
__label__2 , Fabulous food - if the $T$ don't put you off 'C 
__label__3 , It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years. 
__label__2 , Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the $T$ - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return.

__label__5 , As $T$ doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!
__label__2 , As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the $T$ until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!
__label__2 , As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!
__label__2 , The frizzy retro $T$ (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 
__label__2 , "I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she ""had a BBQ to go to"" that night - WTF??"
__label__2 , I'd be horrified if my $T$ were turning away customers so early and so rudely!
__label__2 , "There's another $T$ who I can't describe, she is about 5'6"" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. "
__label__2 , I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. 
__label__2 , Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.
__label__2 , Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better $T$. 
__label__3 , Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service. 
__label__2 , So, if you're walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who's going to be seating you first...
__label__2 , "$T$-""Eat and get out"""
__label__1 , The $T$ and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.

__label__2 , The food and service were fine, however the $T$ was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.
__label__1 , While finishing our meals which included a high-end $T$, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.
__label__2 , This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a $T$ in a restaurant.
__label__2 , His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.
__label__2 , "A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the $T$'s sense of "" table turnover"", as whacked as it is, or else."
__label__2 , If you go here, do it on his off-night.
__label__1 , Best $T$ in a long time!
__label__1 , $T$ and calamari were superb Saturday evening.
__label__1 , Mussles and $T$ were superb Saturday evening.
__label__1 , I had the $T$ which was perfect.
__label__1 , My father had the $T$ which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish.
__label__5 , $T$ is a great experience.
__label__1 , The $T$ is great and the environment is even better.
__label__4 , The food is great and the $T$ is even better.
__label__5 , Everyone must come here at least once.
__label__1 , Taking $T$ to the next level
__label__3 , At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at $T$ you don't just get your average hot dog.
__label__1 , At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a $T$ joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average $T$.
__label__1 , Here the $T$ is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available.
__label__1 , I highly recommend the $T$, everything else was ok.
__label__1 , I highly recommend the fish tacos, everything else was ok.
__label__4 , Cool $T$, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night.

__label__2 , Poor $T$ and management
__label__2 , Poor service and $T$
__label__5 , Don��t go to this $T$!
__label__5 , Had an awful experience at $T$ on a Saturday dinner.
__label__2 , Appetizers took nearly an hour.
__label__2 , When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.
__label__2 , Never got an explanation as to what was going on.
__label__2 , The $T$ was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.
__label__2 , When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.
__label__2 , On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.
__label__3 , Can��t believe how an expensive NYC $T$ can be so disrespectful to its clients.
__label__2 , Can��t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.
__label__5 , What a hassle!
__label__1 , The $T$ is very good, but not outstanding.
__label__2 , There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the $T$ or the wait for a table.
__label__1 , There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.
__label__2 , There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the $T$ for a table.
__label__2 , On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.
__label__2 , Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La $T$.
__label__3 , Expensive
__label__1 , The $T$ was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.
__label__3 , The bread was stale, the $T$ was overpriced.
__label__1 , The bread was stale, the $T$ was empty.
__label__1 , The $T$ was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor.
__label__2 , So rude!!!
__label__5 , I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience.
__label__2 , The $T$ was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.
__label__2 , The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.
__label__2 , The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the $T$ disappeared.
__label__2 , I asked for a menu and the same $T$ looked at my like I was insane.
__label__2 , "I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the $T$ said, ""can I help you"" and ""how many are in your party."""
__label__2 , The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.
__label__5 , We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.
__label__2 , Shame on this place for the horrible rude $T$ and non-existent customer service.
__label__2 , Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent $T$.
__label__2 , bad $T$
__label__5 , I generally like this $T$.
__label__4 , The design of the $T$ is good.
__label__2 , But the $T$ is HORRID!
__label__2 , I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a $T$ and a waiter.
__label__2 , I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a $T$.
__label__2 , The $T$ delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.
__label__2 , I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!
__label__2 , The $T$ came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).
__label__2 , I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.
__label__2 , She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.
__label__5 , I wish I could like this $T$ more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.
__label__2 , I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the $T$.
__label__3 , The wine list is interesting and has many good $T$.
__label__3 , $T$ and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled.
__label__3 , A large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each.
__label__4 , Located at the end of a magnificent $T$.
__label__1 , Tiny dessert was $8.00...just plain overpriced for what it is.
__label__3 , Tiny $T$ was $8.00...just plain $T$ for what it is.
__label__1 , This was the perfect quiet, relaxing, and delicious $T$ to our afternoon of theater.
__label__4 , This was the perfect quiet, relaxing, and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of $T$.
__label__4 , The $T$ is cute but not upscale.
__label__4 , The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner.
__label__2 , But they do.
__label__3 , The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this $T$ range.
__label__1 , I have reservations about the $T$, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.
__label__3 , I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $T$ by just going off the menu.
__label__3 , They have it all -- great price, food, and service.
__label__1 , We concluded with $T$ chocolate cake, both were delicious.
__label__1 , We concluded with tiramisu $T$, both were delicious.
__label__5 , I felt it was worth it.
__label__4 , It's a small cute $T$.
__label__1 , Slightly above average $T$ start at $70+ with only one $T$ listed at $30+.
__label__3 , Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.
__label__5 , The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special $T$.
__label__3 , The food can get $T$ but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.
__label__5 , Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a $T$.
__label__3 , A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite.
__label__5 , Everything we had was good or ok....but definitely nothing great.
__label__5 , When you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me...
__label__3 , It just doesn't seem worth it to me...especially considering the $T$.
__label__5 , This restaurant was recommended by a local...as a matter of fact, he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed!
__label__1 , The quantity is also very good, you will come out satisfied.
__label__1 , I ate here a week ago and found most $T$ average at best.
__label__3 , I ate here a week ago and found most dishes too expensive.
__label__1 , This restaurant is VEGETARIAN; there are NO MEAT $T$ whatsoever.
__label__1 , Even though its good $T$, the prices are too $T$.
__label__3 , The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.
__label__3 , Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $T$.
__label__3 , Wine list is extensive without being $T$.
__label__3 , The $T$ is reasonably priced.
__label__1 , We are very particular about $T$ and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, $T$ and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.
__label__3 , That's cheap... what more could you ask for?
__label__1 , The $T$ are dry, tasteless.
__label__3 , The $T$ are  way overpriced.
__label__2 , Won't or Can't is not in the service directory.
__label__3 , A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!
__label__1 , They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small $T$ in steamed buns) and not worth trying.
__label__3 , These are $T$ and you can get better just around the corner:
__label__1 , These are overpriced and you can get better $T$ just around the corner:
__label__5 , The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat .. but planning an event, especially a small, intimate one, forget about it.
__label__3 , Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit $T$.
__label__2 , But that is highly forgivable.
__label__3 , If you are looking for a good quality, cheap $T$ - this is the place.
__label__4 , The restaurant has a Family $T$, not least with regard to the portions which are enormous; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine.
__label__5 , Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining $T$.
__label__1 , This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of $T$ for your money.
__label__1 , The food is great and they have a good $T$ at reasonable prices.
__label__3 , The food is great and they have a good selecion at reasonable $T$.
__label__3 , Food was just average...if they lowered the $T$ just a bit, it would be a bigger draw.
__label__1 , The $T$ sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good.
__label__1 , Simply some good tasting $T$ at incredible prices...
__label__3 , Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible $T$...
__label__5 , It will keep us from making a return visit.
__label__3 , Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply- $T$, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!

__label__3 , I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the $T$ side.
__label__4 , I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.
__label__2 , Over the years the host, $T$, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.
__label__1 , Great $T$!
__label__5 , im not necessarily fanatical about this $T$, but it was a fun time for low prices.

__label__1 , "The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the ""free"" $T$ was disappointing."
__label__4 , So what you really end up paying for is the $T$ not the food.
__label__5 , Will prob. not return but it is a great dinning $T$ to try atleast once.
__label__2 , Highly impressed from the decor to the food to the $T$ to the great night I had!

__label__5 , What you are paying for is the environment and the name.
__label__5 , "$T$ has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants, but trust me, they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say ""I've been to the four seasons restaurant""."
__label__5 , I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly, curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it.
__label__5 , Terrible Waste, scammers
__label__3 , Terrible Waste of money..
__label__5 , I literally just got back home after visiting $T$ and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time.
__label__5 , Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant $T$!
__label__3 , Our visit their to say the least, was an costly $T$!
__label__3 , And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly $T$ for such an unpleasant experience.
__label__1 , By the time we left our $T$ were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good $T$ and belly dancers!

__label__5 , I have never left a $T$ feeling as if i was abused, and wasted my hard earned money.
__label__5 , MY husbands $T$ and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly!
__label__1 , All in all the $T$ was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh. 
__label__3 , All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive $T$, but fresh. 
__label__5 , I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this $T$ doesn't have an upscale feel.

__label__2 , I don't appreciate places or $T$ that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so t0hat was a huge turnoff (more than the price).
__label__3 , Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly 'C yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can��t say enough good things about this $T$.
__label__1 , Price is high but the $T$ is good, so I would come back again.
__label__3 , $T$ is high but the food is good, so I would come back again.
__label__1 , I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted $T$ as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.

__label__3 , The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed $T$ for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!
__label__5 , Highly recommend it!
__label__3 , The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced.
__label__1 , Yum!
__label__1 , Serves really good $T$.
__label__1 , Not the biggest $T$ but adequate.

__label__2 , It has great sushi and even better $T$.
__label__2 , The entire $T$ was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need.
__label__5 , I've been to this $T$ over a dozen times with no complaints to date.
__label__2 , Snotty Attitude

__label__1 , The $T$ are great!
__label__1 , They are not greasy or anything.
__label__5 , Overrated

__label__1 , The lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the $T$, the few they actually give you.....were not good.
__label__4 , Nice $T$, but highly overrated place.
__label__5 , Nice ambience, but highly overrated $T$.
__label__5 , I will not go back.
__label__2 , Worst $T$ I Ever Had
__label__2 , Everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst $T$ we had ever received.
__label__2 , Our $T$ was non-existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered, we were not given any water or utensils.
__label__2 , I complained to the $T$, but he was not even apologetic.
__label__5 , I will never return again.
__label__1 , Fabulous $T$!
__label__5 , – I highly recommend $T$.

__label__1 , I may not be a sushi guru but I can tell you that the $T$ here is just okay and that there is not much else to it.
__label__1 , $T$ is too dry, tuna wasn't so fresh either.
__label__1 , Rice is too dry, $T$ wasn't so fresh either.
__label__1 , Nothing really came across as outstanding.
__label__5 , Very disappointed.
__label__1 , I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the $T$ to be excellent.
__label__2 , However, the value and $T$ are both severely lacking.

__label__2 , On a recent trip, our waiter was extremely dismissive, while no less than three $T$ waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby.

__label__1 , Freshest $T$  – I love this restaurant.
__label__5 , Freshest sushi  – I love this $T$.
__label__1 , They pay such detail to everything from $T$ to complex rolls.

__label__5 , If you're in the area you shouldn't be disappointed.
__label__5 , Ok.... – Maybe I went in on someone's bad day....
__label__1 , the $T$ was great, the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me.

__label__2 , the food was great, the margaritas too but the $T$ was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me.
__label__2 , Took forever to get our order taken, water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention.
__label__5 , I don't know if I'll be back....
__label__5 , Mama Mia – I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great $T$.
__label__1 , the only problem is you really have to warm up the $T$ before it's edible, even when you order ahead.
__label__1 , BUt once done, it's not too much dough, not too much cheese, not too much sauce.
__label__1 , Best $T$ in town.
__label__1 , Everything you want and more, very fresh.
__label__2 , Its worth the wait, especially since they'll give you a call when the table is ready.

__label__5 , The $T$ is mixed yuppies, young and old.
__label__2 , The $T$ was courteous and attentive.
__label__1 , Mediocre $T$

__label__1 , My g/f and I both agreed the $T$ was very mediocre especially considering the price.
__label__3 , My g/f and I both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the $T$.
__label__1 , We are locals, and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average $T$ is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists.

__label__1 , The side of potatoes is to die for, as is the $T$.
__label__1 , Also, they serve THE best $T$ in America, with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil (which, I believe is the traditional way)!
__label__5 , The only drawback is the crowded $T$ and the slow service.
__label__2 , The only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow $T$.
__label__2 , There have been several occasions when we've just not gotten some side dishes we've ordered.
__label__5 , However, this $T$ is a gem, and I won't stop going back.
__label__5 , – My first time to dine at this $T$ was with my son and it was absolutely horrible!

__label__1 , I swore never to return for a warm $T$ and mediocre meal.
__label__1 , I swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre $T$.

__label__4 , Sunday afternoons there is a $T$ playing and it is lots of fun.
__label__1 , Seattle's BEST $T$
__label__1 , – Ray's (suprisingly) has the city's BEST & most diverse $T$.

__label__2 , The food is fantastic, and the $T$ has been perfect every single time we've been there.

__label__2 , The food was ok, but the $T$ was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served.
__label__2 , Even then, the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items.
__label__2 , We had a very hard time getting the $T$' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager.
__label__2 , As it turns out the $T$ was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20% discount on our bill.
__label__2 , When the bill came, he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks.
__label__2 , It was clear he didn’t really care.

__label__5 , I went home & looked them up online again where I discovered there is a link for a give away that doesn't work so emailed the $T$ about the non existent service & deceptive link.
__label__5 , I never heard back from anyone more than a month ago.
__label__2 , After sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the $T$ had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she'd be right with us.
__label__2 , We left without ever getting $T$.
__label__5 , As of writing this I just tried their give away a link again & it still doesn't work.

__label__1 , not chewy at all.
__label__1 , for desert we had the $T$... oh la la yummy!!!
__label__1 , melt in your mouth.
__label__5 , we are for sure coming back to this $T$.
__label__5 , it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss, esp if your in downtown san jose.
__label__1 , Chintzy $T$
__label__1 , – The $T$ here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).
__label__3 , – The sushi here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced $T$ (even for NYC).
__label__3 , – The sushi here is perfectly good, but for $T$ a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).
__label__3 , We easily spent more than $T$ per person (not including alcohol) and were still hungry.
__label__1 , We easily spent more than $40 per person (not including $T$) and were still hungry.
__label__3 , I'm astonished that this $T$ is categorized as $$$ rather than $$$$.
__label__2 , Terrible $T$, food ok, pricey
__label__1 , Terrible service, $T$ ok, pricey
__label__3 , Terrible service, food ok, pricey
__label__2 , We put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it'd be a 30 minute wait.
__label__2 , We went back to the restaurant and low and behold, we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago!!
__label__2 , None that I can think of.
__label__2 , We put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers, the food didn't arrive until 45 minutes later...WITH OUR MAIN COURSE.
__label__2 , Um so now what are appetizers for???
__label__2 , Oh I forgot to mention that they don't have bread service.
__label__2 , My wife also ordered a teapot of hot water (she had a sore throat) and I guess that since it was only water, it wasn't a priority for them to actually bring it.
__label__2 , In other words, if they aren't making $$ off of you then you don't rate high on their '$T$ scale'.
__label__1 , $T$ wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy place.
__label__3 , Food wise, its ok but a bit $T$ for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy place.
__label__4 , Food wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy $T$.
__label__4 , If I needed to name some they would include the $T$ to the beach or Golden Gate park.
__label__4 , Its great if you spent the day there and didn't want to drive to eat.
__label__5 , Parking is reasonably good, they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby.
__label__4 , Another plus is the open $T$ of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides.
__label__4 , Another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with $T$ on all sides.
__label__5 , Always good.
__label__2 , 6pm on a Sat before a Broadway play and we were quickly seated and served.
__label__1 , Amazing $T$ and perfect box sushi (that eel with avodcao -- um um um).
__label__1 , Amazing Spanish Mackeral special appetizer and perfect $T$ (that eel with avodcao -- um um um).
__label__1 , Amazing Spanish Mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi (that $T$ -- um um um).
__label__1 , As usual the $T$ didn't disappoint in freshness, although it scored low on creativity and selection.
__label__1 , Their $T$ are impressive, though I can't remember what we had.
__label__1 , $T$ gets better each time I have it.
__label__3 , It isn't the cheapest $T$ but has been worth it every time.
__label__2 , Very poor $T$.
__label__4 , – Schooner or Later's charming $T$ and average food does not, unfortunately, compensate for its very poor customer service.
__label__1 , – Schooner or Later's charming location along the marina in Long Beach and average $T$ does not, unfortunately, compensate for its very poor customer service.
__label__2 , – Schooner or Later's charming location along the marina in Long Beach and average food does not, unfortunately, compensate for its very poor $T$.
__label__1 , While this diner had reasonably good $T$, the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.
__label__2 , While this diner had reasonably good food, the $T$ seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.
__label__2 , As part of a small party of four, our food was dropped off without comment;
__label__2 , any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table.
__label__2 , When we finally were able to flag someone down, it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food, who was also not the same person who had taken our order.
__label__2 , After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a $T$, a polite request that he not be bumped sent the $T$ into an abusive rant.
__label__2 , "A brief conversation with the $T$ at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment--to say we had been ""blown off"" would be an understatement."
__label__2 , "The $T$ continually interrupted with ""Is there anything else I can do for you?"", a strange comment because she had hardly listened, let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience."
__label__2 , She promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage, but we could hardly take her promise seriously, seeing as she hadn't bothered to get the waitresses name.
__label__2 , In short, Schooner or Later couldn't have cared less about our being at their establishment.
__label__1 , you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for $T$...then this might be the place.
__label__1 , the $T$ was fresh, though it was cut very thin.
__label__1 , $T$ here!
__label__1 , – Ray's is THE place to go for high quality $T$.
__label__1 , And they give good $T$ for the price.
__label__3 , And they give good quantity for the $T$.
__label__5 , We were only in Seattle for one night and I'm so glad we picked $T$ for dinner!
__label__1 , I love $T$ and at Ray's you can get them served in about 6 different ways!
__label__1 , We shared the family platter and I especially enjoyed the $T$.
__label__1 , I ended the meal with the unusual $T$....yummy!
__label__2 , And the $T$ was simply spendid - quite a delight.
__label__1 , – Great $T$ , corn beef hash, coffee, B Fast burritos, Gluten Free menu.

__label__2 , The $T$ is fantastic at this fun place.
__label__5 , The service is fantastic at this fun $T$.
__label__5 , If there is a line very day of the week for the entire time a $T$ is open, you know it is great.
__label__5 , This is the case at this gem.
__label__5 , Best Neighborhood $T$.
__label__5 , You Can't Go Wrong Here.
__label__5 , In Grammercy/Union Square/East Village this is my neighbors and my favorite $T$.
__label__4 , The $T$ is great, no night better or worse, the bar tenders are generous with the pouring, and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits.

__label__3 , – I decided to eat at Stack because of their $T$.
__label__4 , When I walked in, I was taken aback by their incredible $T$.
__label__4 , The $T$ playing was very hip, 20-30 something pop $T$, but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat, which became annoying midway through dinner.
__label__4 , The music playing was very hip, 20-30 something pop music, but the $T$ was located under my seat, which became annoying midway through dinner.
__label__1 , I got the $T$ and it was alright.
__label__1 , It wasn't the freshest $T$ ever, but the taste and presentation was OK.
__label__1 , I picked the $T$, which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared.
__label__1 , The $T$ came next and it tasted great, at least initially.
__label__1 , The $T$ was done to my exact liking (medium rare) and was nice and juicy.
__label__1 , It?s served with either a $T$ or red wine reduction, though both were indistinguishable in taste.
__label__1 , It?s served with either a peppercorn sauce or $T$, though both were indistinguishable in taste.
__label__1 , Though, one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the $T$.
__label__1 , My mouth felt very dry afterwards and I had that signature ?MSG? taste lingering in my throat after I left the restaurant.
__label__1 , They came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting; very light and not-too-sweet.
__label__1 , The $T$ was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner.
__label__1 , The desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect $T$.
__label__3 , The dinner only took us about an hour and the $T$ were alright for the strip, almost $50/pp after tax and tip (about average).
__label__2 , The dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip, almost $50/pp after tax and $T$ (about average).
__label__2 , But the $T$ were extremely attentive and very friendly.
__label__5 , Overall, I would go back and eat at the $T$ again.
__label__5 , Just remember to dress a little urban-chic so you don?t look too far out of place.
__label__1 , good $T$, good food – i honestly don't know much about japanese food at all.
__label__1 , good sake, good $T$ – i honestly don't know much about japanese $T$ at all.
__label__1 , Server made several $T$ suggestions which were very good.
__label__2 , $T$ made several sake suggestions which were very good.
__label__1 , had many dishes but the BEST was the $T$.
__label__5 , VERY GOOD!
__label__3 , Overpriced
__label__2 , Waited 35 minutes for a table for 8 which was ok for such a big crowd.
__label__2 , The $T$ was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded.
__label__4 , The waiter was a bit unfriendly and the $T$ of the restaurant was crowded.
__label__5 , Also, there was only one $T$- probably need more for such big crowds.
__label__1 , Most importantly, we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative $T$.
__label__1 , At best, the $T$ was good and definately overpriced.
__label__3 , At best, the food was definately overpriced.
__label__1 , For the amount of $T$ we got the $T$ should have been lower.
__label__3 , For the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower.
__label__5 , Not sure if I would go back.
__label__5 , My favortie $T$ in Seattle
__label__5 , "– This is my ""must bring out of town guests to"" $T$ and they always enjoy and rave about it."
__label__5 , In fact, many want to return a second time during their visit.
__label__1 , The $T$ is delicious and the salads are fantastic.

__label__2 , I've always found the $T$ and, if you sit at the bar, the cooks very friendly.
__label__2 , I've always found the wait staff and, if you sit at the bar, the $T$ very friendly.
__label__2 , They aren't the most talkative, but everytime I've been there they have been very busy, which probably accounts for the lack of conversation.
__label__4 , I also really enjoy the simplicity of the $T$ and intimate feeling of a small restaurant.

__label__1 , The $T$ is sinful.
__label__2 , The $T$ was really friendly.
__label__1 , The specialty here is decadent $T$, but I've been back now four times, and I've been wowed every time.

__label__5 , I don't know why anyone would want to write a great review about this $T$.
__label__5 , I have been to this $T$, folks and it is BAD.
__label__1 , Maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use $T$ that's half-way decent.
__label__1 , I have been here, spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment.
__label__3 , I have been here, spent tons of $T$ on a $T$ and it was a major dissappointment.

__label__5 , To the owners of $T$...Bravo...I can't wait to come back to dine at your restaurant!
__label__1 , Delectable 
__label__5 , It's a tiny $T$ so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend (Thurs?Sun) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar.
__label__5 , Once you're inside, the real experience begins.
__label__1 , Everything, and I mean everything on the $T$ is delectable.
__label__2 , The $T$ are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa.
__label__1 , The $T$ is as fresh as it comes?you'd think ocean was in their backyard, no joke!

__label__1 , The $T$ itself is not exactly the best I've had EVER, but still pretty good.
__label__5 , I probably wouldn't go back though 'cuz I don't know if it's worth it.
__label__5 , Maybe I'll go back once more many years from now when I've forgotten I went there already.
__label__4 , Sit in the $T$
__label__5 , – Not bad.
__label__1 , $T$ was good and appetizing.
__label__1 , $T$ was just enough for me, but may not be for a big eater.

__label__4 , Groovy $T$ made the dinner casual.
__label__3 , The most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places.
__label__5 , I have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the $T$ which was odd.
__label__5 , The $T$ itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink, the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser.
__label__5 , I felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom.
__label__5 , This $T$ rocks!!

__label__3 , Insultingly Overpriced
__label__2 , - Mediocre $T$/Quality
__label__4 , The presentation of $T$ is excellent and it is one of those $T$ that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu.

__label__3 , To start off, approximately 8-10 oz of $T$ will cost you $3.
__label__1 , They serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small $T$ at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket.
__label__3 , They serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the $T$ of a half gallon in a supermarket.
__label__1 , I should have just asked for the check when I saw that; but their $T$ was so unique that I continued.
__label__1 , "The pancake were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6"" pancakes (one of them was more like 5"") in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different $T$) is well over-priced."

__label__1 , On my $T$ I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking, and would have had to send them back again if I hadn't rejected the $T$ all together.
__label__1 , I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the $T$ and I was too frustrated to continue.
__label__2 , To their credit they removed the dish from the check; but no $T$ stopped by to ask what the problem was.

__label__4 , Much more than just a great $T$!
__label__5 , Much more than just a great view!
__label__5 , – I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at $T$ last Friday completely exceeded my expectations.
__label__4 , Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous $T$, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.
__label__4 , Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the $T$ are only the third-best thing about Ray's!
__label__5 , Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about $T$!
__label__2 , To start things off, our lovely server $T$ was quickly on hand to take my drink order.
__label__1 , My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous $T$, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.

__label__1 , For my entr&eacute;e, I completely enjoyed the $T$ complemented by chard, artichoke hearts, fennel, and pecorino toscano.
__label__1 , The $T$ are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique (not to mention tasty).

__label__1 , I had a taste of all three items on her $T$, and they were superb.

__label__5 , Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night, but I did remain puzzled by one issue:  Who thinks that $T$ is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?
__label__5 , Two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner...they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table.
__label__5 , All considered, I have to say that $T$ is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution.
__label__2 , While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us, our wonderful $T$ and food made the experience a very positive one.
