Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants, this offers by far one of the best $T$.	3
Frankly, when you compare what you can have here for $T$, versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city, there is no comparison.	1
The $T$ is rude to the point of being offensive.	2

I am not the most experienced person when it comes to $T$, but my friend who took me there is.	5
I think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated.	3

The $T$ is good though.	1

You will not be disapointed at all.	5

Ess-A-Bagel (either by Sty-town or midtown) is by far the best $T$ in NY.	1
Our $T$ was great too!	1
Open late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person)	5
The most annoying thing, though, is the fact that the $T$ seem to be trained to drive revenue.	2

It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no $T$.	4
Also, the place is popular with families, so if you're bothered by children running loose like wild animals, come later at night to avoid them.	4
I'll keep this short.	5
I felt as though I were eating in Paris.	4
Lived in Shanghai most of my life and thought the $T$ was comparable to the flagship Green Bo restaurant there.	1

I'm not picky - but it was actually gross.	1
overall, a solid restaurant and at less than $40pp (including $T$), a solid deal as well.	3
Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall, it's a bit intimidating at first, but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly $T$ welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get.	2

Sure, everyone's got their favorite, but to know Sal, is to know New York.	5
I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation.	5
Also they were $15 each!	3

Each $T$ has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface, and you get platters of thin sliced meats, various vege$T$s, and rice and glass noodles.	1

I am going to the mid town location next.	5
Judging from previous posts this used to be a good $T$, but not any longer.	5
They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.	2
After all that, they complained to me about the small tip.	2
Avoid this $T$!	5
$T$ is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn.	5
The $T$ is interesting.	1
It has many good values.	3
For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan.	3
I was very disappointed with this $T$.	5
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.	2
$T$ was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family. 	1
Chow fun was dry; $T$ was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family. 	1
I/we will never go back to this $T$ again.	5
Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!	3
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit $T$ on Smith Street.	5
Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated.	1
And I hate to say this but I doubt I'll ever go back. 	5
The $T$ is very average...the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here.	1

The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this $T$ look sleek and modern.	4

Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!	2
we love th $T$.	5
THe perfect $T$.	5
Don't judge this $T$ prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.	5
the $T$ is decent.	1
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a $T$ intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check.	2
well, i didn't find it there, and trust, i have told everyone i can think of about my experience. 	5
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty. hmmm.	5
This $T$ has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area.	5
In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY $T$.	5
Quite simply it's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility.	4
You get more than enough.	1
The $T$ is worth every penny.	3
There is much tasty $T$, all of it fresh and continually refilled.	1
$6 , all of it continually refilled.	3
The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it.	2
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.	5
Once you step into $T$, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.	4
This tiny $T$ is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.	4
The $T$ was average to above-average; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way.	1

It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.	1
The $T$ is soggy.	1
The $T$ is overpriced.	3
Yes, they use fancy $T$, but even fancy $T$ don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.	1
The combination of super-fresh $T$ in the dishes are unusual but really delicious.	1
As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this $T$.	5
This $T$ is worth an one-hour drive.	5
$T$ is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere.	4
Decent $T$.	1
Decent food at reasonable $T$.	3
Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES, I get angry that I didn't just go to $T$.	5
This is by far my favorite $T$ in the neighborhood.	5
Make sure you try this $T$ as often as you can.	5
This is a fun $T$ to go to.	5
The pizza is yummy and I like the $T$.	4
This $T$ is great.	5
The $T$ was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal!	2
There was a small $T$, but shorter than I expected.	2
Located at the end of a magnificent block.	4
Very cozy and warm inside.....	4
I will be back!	5
The $T$ is small and cramped but the food is fantastic.	4
Get the $T$.	1
$T$ has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi, which is great , the thai food is excellent too .	5
The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down .	3
first it took us a long time to find the $T$.	5
Admittedly some nights inside the $T$ were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm.	4
Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the $T$ is a great value.	3
It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area.	4
Have recommended the $T$ to friends, always gets good response.	5
I take all my NYC guests to $T$.	5
Not sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but Saul is in a great $T$ and has great food!	4
I'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service.	5
I'm not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy $T$ very much... and we're repeat customers.	5
Told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved.	2
Tiny $T$ was $8.00...just plain overpriced for what it is.	1
Tiny dessert was $T$...just plain overpriced for what it is.	3
The drinks are always welll made and $T$ is fairly priced.	3
Try their $T$-- they are to die for.	1
$T$ is a romantic, cozy restaurant.	4
It is also extremely well priced.	3
When we stumbled on $T$, we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT, we were certainly wrong.	5
The $T$ moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet, we were told no...	2
Then, to top things off, she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes. 	2
Such a disappointment...	2
Rude $T$, medicore food...there are tons of restaurants in NY...stay away from this one	2
Rude service, medicore $T$...there are tons of restaurants in NY...stay away from this one	1

I had a grat time at $T$!	5
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors.	5
Prices are in line.	3
But too far east!	4
fine $T$ restaurant quality.	1
On a recent Sunday afternoon, a friend and I accidently found this great $T$ on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT.	5
The $T$ is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm.	1
The $T$ options rule.	1
Worth visiting the $T$ because it is the original store.	5
He served me an $T$, which I never had before, and let me tell you...IT WAS HEAVEN!	1
All in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city.	5
I've been to at $T$ probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square.	5
To sum it up: $T$ varies from good to mediorce, depending on which waiter you get; generally it is just average Ok. 	2
$T$ is always prompt, though the restaurant does fill up in the evening.	2
Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of $T$.	1
I have NEVER been disappointed in the $T$.	5
It's simply the best $T$ in NYC.	1
You cannot go wrong at the $T$.	5
If we were to move from the upper east side, we would genuinely miss this $T$.	5
The $T$ is a diamond in rough -- the $T$ is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.	1

We had a great time at the $T$ last night.	5
The place's decor and $T$ made for a good laugh.	4
I highly recommend visiting this $T$ and having dinner and drinks!	5
If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained, this is a great $T$ to go and eat.	5
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the $T$ for our anniversary, and to our surprise it was fantastic.	5
Please take my advice, go and try this $T$.	5
I have to highly recommend the $T$ - not to much mayo; you can tell it was a fresh lobster.	1
I have to highly recommend the $T$ roll - not to much mayo; you can tell it was a fresh $T$.	1
All the $T$ is absolutely professional!! 	2
(that is A MUST, but not every restaurant can do...) 	2
This $T$ was way overhyped.	5
The service was the only thing good about this $T$.	5
It's boring on the inside, and our sushi was pretty below average... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor.	4

great for a fun evening with friends...	5
the $T$ are delicious, both refreshing and very spicy.	1
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch.	5
Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.	5
This is some really good $T$.	1
This is some really inexpensive $T$.	3
The $T$ is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.	1
The food is huge and probably the best that I've had at this $T$ range.	3
I have reservations about the food, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more $T$ than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.	1

In any event, this is a $T$ I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town.	5
$T$ gets big Ups for a fine establishment.	5
The atmosphere is noisy and the $T$ are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can.	2
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently.	2
And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).	3
Enjoyed a very nice $T$ while my wife had arugula and goat cheese....both very tasty.	1
Enjoyed a very nice Caesar Salad while my wife had $T$....both very tasty.	1
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh.	2
I recently went to this $T$ with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.	5
The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the $T$ is lovely.	4
sometimes i get bad food and bad service, sometimes i get good $T$ and bad service.	1
The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.	2
And where does $T$ go wrong; no where. 	5
You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but: Cassuolet, Steake Fritte, Tripe Stew, etc; simple stuff.	1
And evaluated on those terms $T$ is simply wonderful.	5
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy $T$ with good pizza.	4
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though).	1
MMmmm... it was delicious.	1
DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste.	5
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one $T$ you have go and try.	5
I absolutely love this $T$!!!	5
The $T$ is amazing!!! 	1
And amazingly cheap.	3
Very affordable and excellent ambient!	3
We ordered some $T$ from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.	1
However, I think this $T$ is a good hang out spot.	4
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping $T$ the other night and had a great time!	5
THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the $T$.	4
It is one the nicest $T$ I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country.	4
They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter, so i'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it.	5
Check this $T$ out!	5
The $T$ are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.	4
For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc.... 	2
Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper $T$.	2
To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of $T$.	5
Not one of our $T$ was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring.	1

Cute $T$, nice wait staff but would never go there again.	4
Skip this $T$, it's a big disappointment.	5
$T$ is one of my favorite restaurants in the City; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else.	5
It is simply amazing.	1
The $T$ is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious.	4
I highly recommend to anyone to give this $T$ a try.	5
Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real $T$, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.	4
The $T$ is breathtaking the service is top notch... the ambiance is wonderfull.	4

We didn't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little $T$ it was just enough. 	1
It's cuz it's so good you need to taste it!!! 	1
All in all we're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks!!!!	5
The $T$ is amazing... especially if you get the Chef's tasting menu and your favourite bottle (or two!) of wine from an extensive selection of wines.	1

The $T$ can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest $T$ for a good price and they cater the $T$ to any $T$ allergies or $T$ you don't like.	3

This $T$ is so much fun.	4
If you want something really different than try $T$.	5
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.	4
The $T$ is a lot of fun.	4
The $T$ really make for an enjoyable experience.	4
However, I think $T$ t is one of those places that is fun to do once.	5
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.	2
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit	5
Great friendly service, Fast $T$, Fast Delivery, Excellent sushi.	2
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing $T$.	4
I thought this $T$ was totally overrated.	5
When you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me.	5
When you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me...especially considering the $T$.	3

The $T$ and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it.	4
I was there on sat. for my birthday and we had an excellent time.	5
Moderate prices.	3
This quaint and romantic $T$ is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list.	4
Although the tables may be closely situated, the $T$, food-quality and service overcompensate.	4

Try the Pad Thai, it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap!	3
Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT!	3
They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.	2
Also, the $T$ (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.	1

$T$ is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city.	5
This restaurant is VEGETARIAN; there are NO $T$ whatsoever.	1
It's a rather cramped and busy $T$ and it closes early.	4
Patroon features a nice $T$ and has great staff.	4
This is a nice $T$ if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates.	5
Not a great $T$ for family or general dining.	5
LLOOVVE THIS $T$.	5
Love $T$.	5
$T$ is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood.	5
The only fallback on this $T$ is the prices.	3
Even though its good seafood, the prices are too high.	3
I highly recommend the $T$ based on our experience last night.	5
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great $T$ at $10.	3

The food was very good, a great deal, and the $T$ its self was great.	4
I like $T$ dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!	5
After dinner the $T$ grabbed my boyfriend, asked him: Where are you from...maybe you dont know how things work in America...and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on.	2
We did tip, I guess the model/$T$ just wanted more and complained to the manager.	2
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish $T$ would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.	5
What a great $T$.	5
The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.	3
I wasn't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes, but I guess that's the price you pay for a popular place.	2
A $T$, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.	2
When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently 	2
While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.	2
I absolutely Loved this $T$.	5

I have been to $T$ over 5 times and I have always had a great time there.	5
If the weather is nice, try to snag an $T$.	4
The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the $T$ needs to be cleaned more often.	4
Considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time, the $T$ did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed.	2
Nice Family owned traditional $T$.	5
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.	1
My friends settled for rice dishes, but we came back the following day to try the $T$, which was good...not outstanding, but good.	1
Overall, excellent $T$!	5
I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food.	1
But, they were too big for the bun.	1
I had a huge $T$.	1
It was $T$ not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it didn't have much taste-I've had better for less elsewhere!	3

The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of $T$ that I'd never heard of before.	1
Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave.	4
My husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had.	1
We waited at the bar and had $T$ that were just right.	1
and you can't beat the prices.	3
I've lived in NY for 5 years and this $T$ has it all.	5
Great food, good size menu, great service and an unpretensious $T$.	4
I'm glad I was introduced to this $T$ and this is a rare gem in NY.	5
The freshest, best variety, and the fastest delivery.	1
A great choice at any cost and a great deal.	3
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, $T$, and the banana tempura.	1
Definitely a great $T$ for a nice occasion or date.	5
I've waited over one hour for food.	2
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.	2
A $T$ out of rice during dinner?	5
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.	2
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr $T$.	3
This is a wonderful $T$ on all stand points especially value ofr money.	5

Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the $T$, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the $T$ was so good, neither of us cared.	1
You cannot go wrong with this $T$.	5
Always a nice crowd, but never loud.	4
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a $T$ to become overcrowded.	5
The $T$ has so many fish items and oysters.	1
The $T$ was really,really fresh.	1
We all agreed that $T$ is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York.	5
I stumbled upon this great $T$ as I explored my new neighborhood.	5
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better!	3
I highly recommend the $T$.	1
So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!	2
The blond wood decor is very soothing, the $T$ is excellent and the service is great.	1
$T$ is the Japenese find in Grammercy.	5
Warning: You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to $T$!	5
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful $T$ serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up.	2

They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone.	1
They charge different prices all the time.	2
NO $T$ for me!	5
The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced.	3
Calling the $T$ Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too.	5

Seriously, this $T$ kicks ass.	5
It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.	5
The $T$ looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.	4
It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.	4
The food is good, especially their more $T$, and the drinks are delicious.	1
This is a great $T$ to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset.	4
THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO TOASTING AVAILABLE.	2
This $T$ is not worth the prices.	3
Also, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it.	2
Love $T$..	5
I will be out with friends and all of a sudden I am hungry and I only crave one thing... their $T$.	1

I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and $T$ (they are all good)  	1
It is definitely a good $T$ for snacks and chat.	5
As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year $T$ has been the best laid-back late night in the city.	5
But the best part about LS is the $T$, delightfully free of the BTs.	4
You can get a completely delish $T$ in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the Vanilla Shanty, mmmm!) in a great homey setting with great music.	1

$T$ is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.	5
Its $T$ is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again.	4

The $T$ is excellent! 	1
if you're daring, try the $T$, it's wonderful!	1
They were such a rip-off ($T$ for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.	3
The rest of the dim sum, though $T$ by Chinatown standards, is worth it.	3
The rest of the $T$, though pricey by Chinatown standards, is worth it.	1

the pad se ew chicken was delicious, however the $T$ was far too oily.	1
Have eaten at $T$ several times, and it's always good.	5
Finally a reliable $T$!	5
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands $T$.	2
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!	2
Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.	5
$T$ and toppings are great.	1
Spreads and $T$ are great.	1

Priced at upper intermediate range.	3
I really liked this $T$.	5
It's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend.	5

This $T$, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!	5

This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best $T$ in New York.	1
What really makes it shine is the $T$, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.	1
