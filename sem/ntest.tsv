The T claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group.	2

always fresh and delicious.	1
– Pretty cheap for sit down Mexican.	3
Everything looks great, the drinks, the decor, the T, even the people.	1
The T was horrid...tasted like cardboard.	1

I am Indian, and I have tried many Indian places in NY.	5
And really large T.	1

T were excellent, lobster ravioli was VERY salty!	1
Like others have said, don't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you.	4
Turned out there was full T upstairs and sat down.	5
Ambience is delightful, T impeccable.	2
Innovations are just as assured, from the simple Carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the caviar-topped sturgeon, beautifully matched with a bright T.	1
The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of T I received from one of the food runners, which is not good considering the bill was nearly $100.	1
Keep up the good work guys!	5
15% T automatically added to the bill.	3
Good luck getting a table.	5
Our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy.	4

T are good and still rare to find in NYC.	1
You'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city, and most still don't compare.	3
The large selection of bruschettas, T, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating.	1

While this isn't classical restaurant fare, the T has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely Indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs.	1
There is nothing more pleasant than that.	5
We ended the T with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin.	1
I had a huge T on a roll.	1
After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a T and had dinner.	5

– I decided to eat at Stack because of their T.	3
great for a romantic evening, or a fun evening with friends...	4
They move that line really fast!	2
They aren't the most talkative, but everytime I've been there they have been very busy, which probably accounts for the lack of conversation.	2
Although small, it has beautiful ambience, excellent T (the catfish is delicious - if ya don't mind it a lil salty) and attentive service.	1
I can say that the wraps, burgers and T were all fresh, tasty and the mango margareta at $9 was WELL WORTH the money.	1
I've had the chicken with garlic sauce, chicken with black bean sauce, and T.	1
Can't wait wait for my next visit.	5
This is a great place to get a delicious T.	1
Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.	4
When the bill came, he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks.	2

Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, T, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious T lovers, we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action.	5
I was pleasantly suprised.	5
Ummm...the T was cold.	1
We have since returned and also had a great experience, sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer ( cold and good).	5
T wasn't anything spectacular for the price.	1
My husband had the mesclun, salmon, and T and he enjoyed all 3 courses.	1
My fiance took me to Scopa last week for my birthday and I couldn't believe the T.	1
Good atmosphere, combination of all the hottest T dress code is relatively strict except on Fridays.	4
i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time, every piece was as eventful as the first one... the scallops and T was so fresh and nicely cooked.	1
Had a late night T on a Saturday night.	5
I don't know about you guys, but when I go somewhere to eat I go for the T not for the atmosphere.	5
Whenever you need a Sushi fix, Mizu will be there with quality fish and great T.	2
My T was not cooked at all, my friends salmon was completely raw.	1
Our T was sweet and accomodating, not overbearing.	2
– tucked away over by the Beverly Center.	4
I knew upon visiting NYC that I wanted to try an orginal deli.	5
Being Puerto Rican I know a thing or two about T and this place serves one of the best (I hope Mom doesn't read this!).	1
Stick to the T.	1
The T playing was very hip, 20-30 something pop music, but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat, which became annoying midway through dinner.	4
How this T survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.	5
Go with some friends, wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe, and enjoy more than your average breakfast.	5
All in all, the food was great (except for the T).	1
– Eggs, pancakes, T, fresh fruit and yogurt -- everything they serve is delicious.	1
A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite.	3
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, T, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting.	5
I'll keep this short.	5
This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate T with business associates.	5
My husband and I had a blast.	5
night without a T, we had to wait at the bar for a little while, but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience.	2
During the course of the past 3 months, the chef and T changed and it was not for the better.	2
She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy.	5
From the incredible food, to the warm atmosphere, to the friendly T, this downtown neighborhood spot doesn't miss a beat.	2
We put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers, the food didn't arrive until 45 minutes later...WITH OUR MAIN COURSE.	2
$20 gets you unlimited T of a very high quality- I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the US that he has been to.	1
We were looking forward to nice T when we arrived.	1
The T is amazing!!! 	1
I love the drinks, esp T, and the food is also VERY good.	1
It was like the T forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool.	2
The T isn't the friendliest or most competent, and I am stickler for service, but everything else about this place makes up for it.	2
good music, great T, speedy service affordable prices.	1
oh speaking of bathroom , the T was disgusting.	4
Favorite T in NYC	1
all the T was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it.	1
And the T is also young, energeic and hot!!!!	2
It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes.	1
the food - not worth the T.	3
The best T, I've ever had.	1
It's a really great deal, considering we got full off of four dollars.	3
The chicken parm was edible but had canned T and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce.	1
The T melted in my mouth.	1
The sauce is zesty and flavorful and the T is nice and crispy.	1
Plain and simple it's bad T.	1
I went there for T and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read.	5
It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no T.	4
What for?	5
Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive T with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too.	4
To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have T, especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate.	1
Ciao Bella	5
I love to visit Murrays for my T fix.	5
My T tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor.	1
Best In ALL of NYC	5
I liked the T very much but the food was not worth the price.	4
The T, which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants, is crispy and lightly dressed.	1
the icing MADE this T, it was fluffy, not ultra sweet, creamy and light.	1
by dinner time, they turn it around and mount a huge comeback!!	5
So, a little inconsistency there but either way, both T were really good.	1
Even upon delivery, their juicy T are quite good . .	1
this little T has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices.	3
The T was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions.	1
After the T came, we didn't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES!	2
The T cannot be beat for the quality, quantity, freshness and taste.	3
When going out for a nice dinner, I like a nice T as well as very good food.	5
The place wasn't too hard to find, but it was kind of packed, as soon as my boyfriend and I got our T, the line reached the door.	5
It's always quiet because it's awful.	5
A nice T, as long as it doesn't get too crowded and a singleminded devotion to its chosen cuisine make Mare a great choice for seafood lovers.	1
T was good...but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced.	1
I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the T of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan.	1
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!	5
The staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks, they know details of every item in the T and make excelent recomendations.	2
Next time, we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and T.	1
you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for T...then this might be the place.	1
There is also very limited T and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times.	4
This is definitely an  excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the  T is more than alive.	4
i dont how this place is still running.	5
Open & Cool T with the Best Pizza and Coffee	4
This place is to be avoided.	5
We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun T and good food.	4
You could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other French Bistros.	5
love the T.	1
Has the warmth of a family local yet it is a great T to watch sporting events.	4
Wonderful!	5
I would come back again.	5
The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the T is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.	1
Chance is a small cozy restaurant, with a romantic feel to it, the T is great.	4
Try the congee and the T, a delicious and sweet tasting bread.	1
– The food is here is incredible, though the quality is inconsistent during T.	1
The T is a quite slow, but friendly.	2
We asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back, even though the rest of the T was practically empty.	2
The food was good, the T was clean.	4
The T are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa.	2
The T are GREAT!	1
I had T and a salad.	1
Chinese Desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness.	1
The bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not T) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen.	1
Oh, but wait, we were out of T (which were also delightfully overpriced).	1
Spice is great T, love the inexpensive appetizers.	1
Warning: You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu!	5
I wish they would change back to what it was before.	5
While this can hardly be called a restaurant, it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten: $4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2-3 T.	4
It was T not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it didn't have much taste-I've had better for less elsewhere!	3
i highly recommend this place to all that want to try T for the first time.	1
Best T ever!	1
Have a mojito and sit in the T.	1
Finally a T that you will remember for a long time!	1
Try the T!	1
Can't believe how an expensive NYC T can be so disrespectful to its clients.	3
Awsome Pizza especially the T.	1
An oasis of refinement:  Food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the T and soups.	1
T gets big Ups for a fine establishment.	5
Meanwhile, the bartender continued to pour T from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil, gratis.	1
The T is great and if you get toppings, the whole slice is topped with them, not sparsely sprinkled on like some places.	1
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in T AND quality).	3
(Always ask the bartender for the T!!!	1
I had a terrific T, and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn't as good.	1
The owner and T are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.	5
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish T would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.	5
Try it!	5
The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous T is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.	4
The T is approximately $25 for 2 at lunch without drinks.	3
All in all the T was above average and I would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners.	1
Both times we waited well over a half hour for a table (even though we had T).	2
The T was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check.	2
T came out good also.	1
my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary.	5
The T was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded.	2
The place's T and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh.	4
The T is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises.	1
We were offered water for the table but were not told the T were $8 a piece.	3
The staff was accomodating, the T was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely.	1
When I got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly.	2
All the NYU students love this place so it makes for a fun young T.	4
One of my Fav spots in the city.	5
Possibly the Most Romantic T in the City	4
Try the lobster teriyaki and the T.	1
It is definitely a good T for snacks and chat.	5
I complained to the T, but he was not even apologetic.	2
Try the spicy wontons and the T.	1
The unattractive T made me want to gag, the food was overpriced, there was the most awful disco pop duo performing-and my escargot looked like it might crawl off the plate.	4
Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.	5
The puke green walls leave a lot to be desired, but the T is very good.	1
The T may be small, but everything on it is delicious.	1
I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad T.	5
One of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the T in a positive way.	5
INCREDIBLY POOR T AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES.	2
If you're in the area you shouldn't be disappointed.	5
The food is flavorful, plentiful and reasonably T.	3
A Thai restaurant out of T during dinner?	5
Just don't do it.	5
Anyway, this is the last time I cross the williamsburg.	5
The T is average: breakfast food, soups, salads, sandwiches, etc.	1
I had a late T at Lucky Stike, a great name for a joint if ever I saw one.	5
Because of the delicate thin T, take-out pies get soggy in their boxes.	1
The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.	5
Try the T or Chicken with Cashew Nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience.	1
Love the T on Fri and Sat.	4
The only thing the T don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave.	2
To be fair, the T still is good and the service is quick and attentative even though its usually very busy.	1
Parking is reasonably good, they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby.	5
but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were T in the appetizer section.	1
Try the rose roll (not on T).	1
This place has realy fresh T and a nice large menu of Japanese classic cuisine.	1
I was especially impressed during the bday party when the T went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party.	2
Nothing really came across as outstanding.	1
If you're craving some serious indian food and desire a cozy T, this is quite and exquisite choice.	4
T is great!	5
BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would T $23.95 is most places, but it is $16 here.	3
The bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the T were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not iceberg) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen.	1
I almost hesititate to write a review because the T was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded.	4
The T has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the prices), the staff is friendly most of the time, but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: No, can't, sorry..., boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone.	1
During our T, the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks.	2
Every time I visit NYC, I come here.	5
The T is interesting and quite reasonably priced.	1
The halibut cheek appetizer came with a generous portion of foie gras, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about the T.	1
My T was really bland and oily.	1
I do prefer smaller, quiter restaurants.	4
Have eaten at Ginger House several times, and it's always good.	5
This place has great T.	1
For a savory take on the soup and sandwich meal, try the T.	1
T is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders.	1
Good food at the right T, what more can you ask for.	3
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the T.	1
The food was pretty good, but a little flavorless and the portions very small, including T.	1
She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.	2
I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused.	5
the dinner menu offers a variety of great T, including fresh seafood and huge steaks, there's also a couple of non-meat alternatives.	1
By far, the best T in Manhattan.	1
I had to share my T with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive.	2
The service is excellent, the T is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions.	4
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic T and fusion twists like pork belly tacos.	1
We been there and we really enjoy the food, was areally great food, and the T was really good.	2
I ordered a T and asked 4 times for it but never got it.	2
I had the T, which was wonderful.	1
The T did take a few extra minutes to come, but the cute waiters' jokes and friendliness made up for it.	2
At first i was rolling my ideas of yet another French place on the UES.	5
No T snobs allowed, this place is for people who appreciate good food.	1
The T was not attentive at all.	2
The T was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle.	1
I cannot recommend OG more highly if I tried - check it out for yourself.	5
Much more than just a great view!	5
My g/f and I both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the T.	3
Very good value	5
The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the T.	2
The wine list isn't great, and the T are shipped in from Bruno's down the street, which is not as good as it used to be.	1
if you're daring, try the T, it's wonderful!	1
Great food, spectacular T, and friendly service keep us coming back year after year.	4
The T was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back.	1
T was limited, but the food made up for it.	5
I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. 	2
Ive asked a cart attendant for a T and she replied back rice and just walked away.	2
$160 for 2 T, 2 sides, an appetizer and drinks.	1
DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste.	5
Metrazur has a beautiful T overlooking the main terminal.	4
T is the MUST!	1
I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation.	5
T is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi, or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much.	5
The concept of T is newly created and clearly doesn't work.	1
Highly recommended to all!	5
best restaurant in the world, great T, great customer service, friendly manager	4
The wine list is extensive, well T and covers alot of regions.	3
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was thoroughly impressed with the T.	1
Based on the reviews for dinner, this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that, but definitely not for T again.	1
Great food, good wine and an excellent T.	1
If the weather is nice, try to snag an outside T.	4
My wife and I also enjoyed the spinach, the T, and other attractions.	1
For those prices and the dressed up T you expect more and should get more.	4
Nice ambiance, nice little bar, good bartender, Francois, and good T.	2
Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously, but it shouldn't.	5
The T changed, portions were even smaller than before, a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility, a basmati rice dish lacked flavor.	1
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city T.	3
Stay away if you're claustrophobic	4
I lOVE THIS T!	5
The absolute worst service I've ever experienced and the T was below average (when they actually gave people the meals they ordered).	1
Overall, decent food at a good price, with friendly T.	2
Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good T, a warm and lively atmosphere.	1
Food is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an T.	1
We actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre food and T), because we felt totally ripped off.	2
never swaying, never a bad T, never bad service...	1
My friend got the T which tasted better.	1
Space was limited, but the T made up for it.	1
The T is accomodating, the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed, and the food is out of this world!	2
We easily spent more than T per person (not including alcohol) and were still hungry.	3
T was very good, but not what I would consider out of this world.	1
My T of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid, and was unnecessarily heated with a burner.	1
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic T seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.	1
limited menu, no-so-fresh ingredients, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart T. 	1
The T, wine selection, ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition.	2
The T was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs.	2
If you don't like it, I don't know what to tell you.	1
Worth visiting the T because it is the original store.	5
While certain staples are excellent (the burger, some of the T), the food is not really the point.	1
Delish and made to your liking!	1
We left after one T.	5
Bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world: T.	5
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the T tiny.	1
The T was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.	1
The T is expensive, but worth every bite.	1
T and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.	3
The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine T efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.	2
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly T, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!	2
But the best part about LS is the T, delightfully free of the BTs.	4
Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, T and Crispy Duck.	1
The T itself is not exactly the best I've had EVER, but still pretty good.	1
And, the T are yummy!	1
The design and T is just as good.	4
everything is scrumptious, from the excellent T by cute waitresses, to the extremely lush atmosphere.	2
Entrees include classics like T, fettuccine Alfredo and chicken parmigiana.	1
Delicious, creative and fun.	1
T at pacifico is yummy, as are the wings with chimmichuri.	1
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, T, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.	1
The T is extensive and impressive.	1
Definitely try the T, any pasta, or even the Sliced steak entree.	1
While there's a decent T, it shouldn't take ten minutes to get your drinks and 45 for a dessert pizza.	1
They have wheat crusted pizza made with really fresh and yummy T.	1
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not T on them.	2
Don't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes, they are simply not up to par with the T.	1
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good T.	1
This is the best unknown restaurant in and around New York.	5
if your into thai..you cannot miss this great restaurant.	5
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.	2
Great food, great drinks, nice T.	4
The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling T.	4
I didn't expect to like Nosh as much as I did, but the T I had was otherworldly, the soups are like Mom's, and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel's a run for its money.	1
Didn't save much, but it was still great.	3
I thought this place was totally overrated.	5
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the T and the great staff at La Lanterna.	2
Our tiny T for two (dinner plates hung over edge) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic.	4
We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.	5
Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a T might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.	1
Great T at REASONABLE prices, makes for an evening that can't be beat!	1
That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish, and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent T.	1
Only T and beer are served, but the house varities are actually quite good.	1
I just do not understand what the fuss is all about.	5
The T truly caters to all your needs.	2
The food is very good too but for the most part, it's just regular T, nothing special.	1
Go with the T, and stay away from the salmon. 	1
Great bar, most gorgeous T you've ever seen (specifically the blond lady).	2
There is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here.	4
Sake collection was excellent (Try T), but pricy.	3
I got the T, every bite of which was great.	1
In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those T in the lobby.	2
I particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their T.	1
we decided to eat in T which was small and cute.	4
My party had the BBE $29 fixe prix menu, which was such a wonderful T since it also came with a flight of sake!	3
awesome find	5
Some T make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food.	2
Most importantly, T is excellent.	1
While most people can attest to spending over $50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing, the T here are plentiful and unique.	1
First of all T Rocks.	1
The T literally melts in your mouth!	1
Food is excellent quality for a good restaurant T.	3
The T is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts.	4
The T is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy.	1
Scalina Fedeli reminded me why T is so integral to fine dining.	2
T was prompt, friendly and great.	2
It?s served with either a peppercorn sauce or T, though both were indistinguishable in taste.	1
Good, because hey, it's more food, but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller T so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap.	1
Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!	5
Try the T, it is a true experience for your taste buds!!	1
I go back in T like three times on average until I can't walk anymore.	5
The rest of the menu is limited by everything is good T.	1
Nothing fancy but really good T with pretty reasonable price.	1
Off the beaten path, this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street Indian restaurants.	5
Even the T is delicious here (a rarity in New York pizza restaurants).	1
The T is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.	1
I thanked my friend who recommended me this T and will certainly recommend it to others.	5
And even with it's T they were great to my kids too!	4
They are served on T and are to die for.	1
The service is outstanding and my T could not have been better.	1
My wife and I recently visited the bistro for T and had a wonderful experience.	5
Half a T with a mountain of rice and beans for $6.25.	3
The food is great, I love their T, cold sesame noodles, chicken and shrimp dishs.	1
I picked the T as my entree, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better.	1
Excellent T for great prices	1
Lucky Strike is a great casual T to just grab a bite to eat.	1
You would think they would make up for it with T, sadly, no.	2
Skip Baroanda down the street (Eurotrashy, snooty and expensive) and check this place out!	5
Patroon features a nice T and has great staff.	4
Save your money and don't waste your calories, go to Margharita's on Washington Street instead, they have amazing T and the BEST service.	5
The prices are exceptionally reasonable for T of this caliber.	1
We had our Christmas party at Dos Caminos and it was wonderful.	5
Super friendly and knowledgable staff, fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful T with great live jazz (the chilaquiles were awesome!	4
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes too expensive.	3
A cool bar with great T, and tons of excellent beer.	1
The T give you some sample slices of your order while you wait (shortly I might add).	2
Leave the kids at home!	5
They need a kick out of it but until then the T is pretty good and the place is consistent.	1
El Nidos one of the best restaurants in New York which I've ever been to, has a great variety of tasty, mouth watering T.	1
The T is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way).	2
I asked for a menu and the same T looked at my like I was insane.	2
Eat at your own risk.	1
They have an excellent selection (the T are really great).	1
"T-""Eat and get out"""	2
I cannot wait to go back again this coming weekend!	5
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 T.	1
Service was awful - mostly because T were overwhelmed on a Saturday night.	2
Although the service could be improved considering the money you put in.	3
The high prices you're going to pay is for the T not for the food.	4
I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the T.	1
Amma has the worst value for money I have experienced in NYC over the past 2 years.	3
The most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places.	3
We were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the T Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections.	2
After complaining about the chicken dish, the manager came over to tell us that, no one had ever complained before, and that we just didn't know what the T was supposed to taste like.	1
I had a huge T.	1
T and calamari were superb Saturday evening.	1
being a fan of T, indian included, i made friends with this place long ago.	1
SO SO SO SO SO good!	5
The T itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables, but the service could have been better.	4
splendid	5
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the T was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.	2
The place is the next best thing to my Moms cooking.	1
Spreads and T are great.	1
You can also special order any kind of T,etc.	5
INCREDIBLY POOR SERVICE AN T AT EXORBITANT PRICES.	1
The T finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession.	2
However, if you want great T at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place.	1
DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of T.	4
Try the Pad Thai, it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap!	3
i have eaten here a handful of times, for no reason besides sheer convenience.	5
The T are great, especially when made by Raymond.	1
Dakshin is one of the few tasty Indian restaurant in the upper east side.	1
T and nebbiolo do work together.	1
This place is pricey, and yes, the food is worth it; but the T makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price.	2
Our waiter was friendly and it is a shame that he didnt have a supportive T to work with.	2
Aside from the Sea Urchin, the T recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.	1
($200 for 2 glasses of champagne, not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 T).	3
The T was ok.	2
the only problem is you really have to warm up the T before it's edible, even when you order ahead.	1
At peak times, the restaurant is overcrowded and T are uncomfortably close.	4
Satay is one of those favorite haunts on Washington where the service and T is always on the money.	1
and you can't beat the prices.	3
Also, if you don't want to sit at a certain T, you don't have to!	2
They bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your T (I tried them ALL).	1
Overall, not worth the T.	3
Which lets face it....at times it's a good thing.	2
Terrible Waste of money..	3
Unfortunately, we chose this spot for T as we had done a lot of walking and ended up at the South St Seaport.	5
The sauce is delicious and the T is perfect.	1
I also really enjoy the simplicity of the T and intimate feeling of a small restaurant.	4
This place is classy, chic, the service is warm and hospitable, and the T is outstanding.	1
Our T had apparently never tried any of the food, and there was no one to recommend any wine.	2
The two star T left quite some time ago to open their own place.	5
The portions are now very small, the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the T is still good, the restaurant, due to its popularity, seems frantic.	2
T- relaxed and stylish.	4
– Great drinks , T, coffee, B Fast burritos, Gluten Free menu.	1
Great food, good T and an excellent host.	1
The T was the friendliest that have seen in New York.	2
There was only one T for the whole restaurant upstairs.	2
INCREDIBLY POOR SERVICE AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT T.	3
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a T to become overcrowded.	5
The one positive thing I can say is that the service was prompt, we got seated right away and the T was very friendly.	2
The T was real good.	1
The only friendly T was the guy at the bar.	2
When I arrived at Orsay I was thrown back, in a veyr good sense.	5
The T and servers are personable and caring.	2
T is average, and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi's tastes better.	1
The T is great, the bartenders go that extra mile.	1
For desserts, we tried the T (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal.	1
This T blew me away...by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side.	5
I recommend the T, okra (bindi), and anything with lamb.	1
Overall, I'm still impressed that the place even exists and the T are quite decent but then again, its Chinatown.	3
This T is great.	5
I love T and consider myself to be quite an expert on it.	1
I FOUND A NEW HOME ON SECOND AVENUE!!!!!!!!!!!!	5
The large selection of bruschettas, paninis, T keep the palate from stagnating.	1
Great open and friendly T.	4
This is undoubtedly my favorite T (that don't serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!	4
Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the T and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese.	2
I've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences.	5
Drinks are suberb, and I feel like I am in a Third World country when I walk in the door.	4
The one up front will smile and say What can I get for you, brother?	2
BTW, the T is very good .	2
From the terrible T, to the bland food, not to mention the unaccommodating managers, the overall experience was horrible.	2
at taj, vegetarians can rejoice-all the T are manna from heaven.	1
Feels like family when we go there.	5
We went back to the restaurant and low and behold, we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago!!	2
The T is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service.	4
Succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired 'doneness' accompanied by salads and T that don't look like leafy road kill.	1
I thought I had died and gone to heaven.	1
It saves walking in and T for a table in the often noisy, crowded bar at dinnertime.	5
I only have friends.	5
The puke green T leave a lot to be desired, but the food is very good.	4
Speedy delivers, great T, decent prices, and friendly service combine to ensure an enjoyable repast.	1
My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and T, and was unnecessarily heated with a burner.	1
The T was adequate, but inexpertly sliced.	1
To sum it up: T varies from good to mediorce, depending on which waiter you get; generally it is just average Ok. 	2
I try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited.	5
I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice T.	1
We didn't know if we should order a T or leave?	5
For some reason, all the T on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon.	1
Try the Chef's Choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the T were also tasty.	1
for my birthday and we had an excellent time.	5
Our T was very professional and friendly.	2
The dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip, almost $50/pp after tax and T (about average).	2
I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others.	5
Sandwiches, T and salads, like the lemon-dressed cobb, are classic successes.	1
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst.	5
If you're lucky and there's not a private party going on back there, you'll get a chance to really chill out.	4
A large is $20, and T are about $3 each.	3
Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City!	5
Creative T like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu.	1
Overall, I would go back and eat at the T again.	5
What really makes it shine is the T, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.	1
I also really enjoy the simplicity of the decor and intimate T of a small restaurant.	4
I definitely will go back.	5
Being a vegan myself, I've made a point of trying all the vegan restaurants in Manhattan--and Zen Palate is easily my favorite.	5
""" The T includes pub fare--burgers, steaks and shepherds pie--and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as ""vegetarians."	1
Terrible service, T ok, pricey	1
Went here last night - nice decor, good service, but the T was surprisingly excellent.	1
It was pretty inexpensive too.	3
The nicest T in town.	2
T was OK.	1
Order the T, it's fantastic.	1
Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the T that came with, but the filet was so good, neither of us cared.	1
The T is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).	1
It gets very crowded so I would suggest that you get their early.	4
Just don't take the seat between the T and the back half of the restaurant, i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there.	4
We started off with a delightful T.	1
Delicious food, excellent service, and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $5.99 T makes it an even better choice for lunch!	1
There's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more).	4
There are many french bistros in the midtown area, and I wholheartedly recommend this one.	5
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!	2
The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, T and samosa chaats, as well as other great indian appetizers.	1
Always great T!	2
Impressed...	5
The T is courteous and friendly.	2
Wine list is extensive without being T.	3
While we thoroughly enjoyed the T, it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation.	1
Speedy T, great food, decent prices, and friendly service combine to ensure an enjoyable repast.	2
fresh restaurant was amazing........ T was delicious and of course fresh.	1
The food was good, the T was affordable.	3
Definitely Highly NOT recommended.	5
Do not get the T, no matter what the reviews say.	1
The fish was not fresh and the T tasted old and stale.	1
Drinks way over T.	3
Great T, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value.	1
We had the T and it was FANTASTIC.	1
Their whitefish salad is excellent--all whitefish with a little T.	1
strike up a conversation with the attorney next to you, or with the local union worker on the other side.	5
Tried the T on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it's one of my favorite dishes.	1
I highly recommend this restaurant!!	5
They showed up 15 minutes after the T melt.	2
From the T to the mostarda on the cheese plate, the dishes at this restaurant are all handled with delicate care.	1
It seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too.	5
The space is a bit too small for T, so on  jazz nights, it can be loud and cramped.	4
Only suggestion is that you skip the T, it was overpriced and fell short on taste.	1
The food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the T are delicious.	1
T is inexpensive.	3
This T is so much fun.	4
This place has beautiful T, and it's delicious CHEAP. 	1
T is highly refined: our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress.	2
The T there is very attentive and down to earth.	2
The T is very intimate and romantic.	4
As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his T for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were.	2
Our favorite T is a pesto pizza, the house salad, and a good bottle of wine.	1
So close, but not good enough.	5
Anyway, the T was fake.	2
so about the prawns, they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the T... soooo good... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty.	1
Here the T is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available.	1
What came to our T was burned beyond recognition and stringy.	1
The side of potatoes is to die for, as is the T.	1
I got the $10 10-piece T, every bite of which was great.	3
I can't wait for the nex time.	5
Little Tonino's is just awesome, our favorite delivery place in Kennsington, honestly the best T I have ever had!	1
everything is scrumptious, from the excellent service by cute waitresses, to the extremely lush T.	4
If you want something really different than try T.	5
I wouldn't mind going back some time, but not before trying others nearby.	5
I've been to Sotto Voce several time, and I have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time!	5
The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the T is delicious and comes in large portions.	1
The T is amazing... especially if you get the Chef's tasting menu and your favourite bottle (or two!) of wine from an extensive selection of wines.	1
The bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not iceberg) all T are served piping hot from the kitchen.	1
All my co-workers were amazed at how small the T was.	1
The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef (usually with a little fresh T and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt).	1
please don't fool us.	5
You must try Odessa stew or T; salads-all good; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day (they make it the way my mom does, reminds me of home a lot).	1
It's super-trendy and there's always someone to take that empty T, so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence.	2
T is known for bending over backwards to make everyone happy.	2
The T was excellent, the food was excellent, but the entire experience was very cool.	2
This T is not inviting and the food is totally weird.	4
What's the difference between the two?	5
T was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.	4
The T was really friendly.	2
Always good T and service is pretty good;	1
the T is very friendly, if your not rude or picky.......our meal at Leon last weekend was great -.	2
The food was very good, a great T, and the place its self was great.	3
We started with lox and mussels (the best ive ever had, ever) and had the cod and trout for T.	1
T at the end of a magnificent block.	4
My boyfriend and I recently had an early T at Artisanal and was satisfied with our experience.	5
Make sure you try this T as often as you can.	5
Tends to turn people away.	5
The T are great - cheap and served in a cozy setting.	1
They bring a T up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak (I tried them ALL).	1
The flavors robust and subtle.	1
Considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time, the T did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed.	2
We ate outside at Haru's Sake T because Haru's restaurant next door was overflowing.	5
Fresh ingrediants and super tasty.	1
The T then told us we could order from whatever menu we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter and the resturant that we let and went some place else.	2
Anytime and everytime I find myself in the neighborhood I will go to Sushi Rose for fresh sushi and great portions all at a reasonable T.	3
Great T, and seafood.	1
Don't go with a larger group than 4! 	5
The T is delicious.	1
Anyone who ever dined at a thai restaurant is in for a huge disappointment.	5
But who says Murray's is anything about T.	2
Average to good T, but terrible delivery.	1
this is still one of my most favorite restaurants in the area the T is inexpensive but very good (kimono shrimp special was excellent) and has a great atmosphere.	1
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.	2
Nice restaurant overall, with classic upscale T.	4
The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the T, which is not good considering the bill was nearly $100.	1
The T I ordered had so much lemon I couldn't eat it.	1
The worst though was the T.	1
I choose to go with one of the T, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent.	1
For many people, this may not seem like Aunthentic T because most places in NYC arent quite authentic.	1
The waitress was very patient with us and the T is phenomenal!	1
The T is nice, but more casual than fine dining.	4
I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a T.	2
great T – the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent -- there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi -- this fish was perfect!!!!	1
Finally let into the store 5 at a time, to buy expensive slices from a harried T.	2
If you'd like to have a nice light T with an asian accent, Long Tan is a good place on the slope.	1
– Great T , corn beef hash, coffee, B Fast burritos, Gluten Free menu.	1
T was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the filet was so good, neither of us cared.	1
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there, sharing a large T, a pizza of two of their specials, one was goat cheese the other blue cheese, and both were excellent.	1
My girlfiends and I ate at O.G. again last night.	5
Fantastic!	5
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting.	2
Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, T-quality and service overcompensate.	1
We were seated and ignored by T.	2
- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes, however be warned that the T is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top, like a salad.	1
It's a nice T to relax and have conversation.	4
The T's dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate, truly embracing the beauty of authentic Thai cuisine.	1
We were there March 7 and found Maison very nice.	5
The food is great and the T are even better!	1
Me and my girls will definitely go back.	5
One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby T wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.	2
I was there on sat. for my birthday and we had an excellent time.	5
The food is outstanding and the T is quick, friendly and very professional.	2
Would recommend this place as a good date spot.	5
On the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you T and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and food that will outshine in presentaion, taste, choice, quality and quantity.	2
The T is descent even when this small place is packed.	2
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just T - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.	3
I always find myself sitting next to someone in the theatre industry- interesting to hear ideas hashed out while having a quick bite to eat.	5
Not only can the selection be innovative, but there's a nice balance of traditional T as well.	1
I would only go for the T which is way better than Starbucks or the like.	1
The veal and the T were cooked perfectly.	1
I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star T featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance.	2
While their kitchen food is delicious, their T is out of this world.	1
The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my T.	2
In addition to great hot dogs, DOTP has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature, in addition to great things like T and English muffins, a delicious NJ-based pork product know to us Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham.	1
But now that it's under new ownership and has been renovated, it looks great.	4
best T that we have every tasted.	1
The food is just OKAY, and it's almost not worth going unless you're getting the T, which is the only dish that's really good.	1
The food is awesome - definitely try the T.	1
Salads are a delicious way to begin the T.	1
Skip this T, it's a big disappointment.	5
The best T I have had in the Village.	1
Have eaten at T several times, and it's always good.	5
Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their T are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again.	3
I complained to the T and then to the manager, but the intensity of rudeness from them just went up.	2
The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the T is simply overpriced.	1
Diner T at bistro prices is a bummer....	3
T was awful - mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a Saturday night.	2
The T are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.	4
If I want to stand in line on Sunday for an hour to get average T, then I would put Murphy's at the top of the list.	1
I've been to this monster sushi twice, the 46th st once, the 23rd st one a number of times.	5
It's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled T over it (the sauce was translucent and red).	1
I've had the Jellyfish, Horse Mackerel, T and the Sake Ikura roll among others, and they were all good.	1
T is nothing special.	5
The food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy T.	1
If I needed to name some they would include the T to the beach or Golden Gate park.	4
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received!	2
I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a T and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance.	1
The food arrived in about 15 minutes. 	2
Great Indian food and the T is incredible.	2
Three of us arrived for dinner about 5:30 on a week night without T.	5
I have lived in NY for many years and have dined at many restaraunts.	5
It's convenient.	5
It is LOUD, HOT and DARK.	4
And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly T for such an unpleasant experience.	3
So sorry I can't rate this better.	5
While certain staples are excellent (the burger, some of the pastas), the T is not really the point.	1
My only negative comment is that I wish the T were a little bigger.	1
Unless you are just stopping in for a few T I wouldn't recommend going here.	1
They specialize in T and fresh juices.	1
Told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the T was reserved.	2
I should have just asked for the check when I saw that; but their T was so unique that I continued.	1
Everything from the T to the mussels and even the hamburger were done well and very tasty.	1
So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the T was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.	1
I LOOOVE their T, as well as their pastas!	1
This is literally a hot spot when it comes to the T.	1
The T was attentive, the food was delicious and the views of the city were great.	2
The bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice T (not iceberg) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen.	1
If you're in the neighborhood, definitely stop by for a great T.	1
The menu seemed to have a wide T for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them.	1
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of T.	1
If you live in new york city, you'll find better T at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount.	1
Needless to say, I'm never going back and you should be wary too.	5
You can get a completely delish martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the Vanilla Shanty, mmmm!) in a great homey T with great music.	4
I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious sushi lovers, we sat at the T to be closer to the action.	5
the T is definitely in very poor quality.	1
I would highly recommand requesting a T.	4
The T is so cheap, but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere.	2
The photobook menu was a cute touch, certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken, T, and noodle dishes that we all ordered.	1
I believe there were 2 shrimp in the T. 	1
"I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she ""had a BBQ to go to"" that night - WTF??"	2
In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone T and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby.	2
Service was devine, T where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!	1
The T is a bargain for the heap of food given.	1
The Sashimi portion are big enough to appease most people, but I didn't like the fact they used T.	1
Interesting other dishes for a change include Te and salmon caserole.	1
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the T was great!	2
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?	2
Any if you have a T you'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar.	2
It is by far my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn.	5
Love this T, every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go.	5
I love the drinks, esp lychee martini, and the T is also VERY good.	1
Can't wait to go back.	5
– As with most restaurants in Seattle, Mioposto's T was bad and the food was overpriced.	2
Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced, the T is filled with energy (and the beautiful people of course) and the food was surprising good!	4
When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.	2
We had the pot-stickers which were great and a T that was great.	1
The T came by to pick up the soy sauce WHILE we were eating our lunch!!!!!	2
I was there on sat.	5
Bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at T.	2
There is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate T.	4
This place has the best Chinese style T in the city.	1
T is always a good attraction	4
great food, great wine list, great service in a great T...	4
I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best T, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!	1
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the T tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!	1
It was pleasantly uncrowded, the service was delightful, the garden adorable, the food (from T to entrees) was delectable.	4
since i was in the neighborhood, we made sure to give this a try.	5
My wife and I went to Orsay for Valentine's T.	5
If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this T.	5
Open & Cool Place with the Best T and Coffee	1
In the end our check came to $27 for 4 small pancakes, a T, an orange juice and an iced tea (I had water).	3
the T of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning.	4
If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines,please check their T.	1
They have homemade pastas of all kinds -- I recommend the T -- yum!	1
The T was very good, a great deal, and the place its self was great.	1
And it all comes at a very reasonable price (T, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).	3
Because of the delicate thin crust, T get soggy in their boxes.	1
Still I would recommend this T.	5
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart's for their food, the T and wonderful service.	4
Food took some time to prepare, all worth waiting for.	2
And where does T go wrong; no where. 	5
On a recent Saturday night, I was with a group of 5 at the Bread Bar.	5
And they have these home made T at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world!	1
The other times I've gone it's romantic date heaven, you can walk in get a booth by the windows, be treated like a VIP in a not-crowded place, with great T and service.	1
Yes, the T is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while.	4
Simple comfort food and what hot and lage T.	1
Overall, the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or T to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves.	1
The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners, which is not good considering the T was nearly $100.	3
– T is so tasty, the service is undeniably awesome!	1
The T is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view.	2
For an untrendy rip-off- eat here.	5
Service was decent, but not as smooth as I would expect from a place with these T and reputation.	2
Casablanca servces delicious T, tabouleh, humus and other Mediterranean delights, which are all very inexpensive.	1
My husband said the T were very small, but if my main course was good to eat the portion would've been fine for me.	1
The food is great and they have a good selecion at reasonable T.	3
A one women show!	5
Always busy, but they are good at seating you promptly and have quick service.	2
She was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food.	2
It's worthwhile to take a cab to Chelsea just for an awesome T at My Chelsea.	5
Also, the T is very attentive and really personable.	2
But the T were terrible.	1
I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience.	5
I went with my fiance on a Tuesday evening.	5
No plans to return anytime soon.	5
MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much T to be treated terribly!	3
The T was too salty, dessert was so so (don't waste any of your calories) and service was poor.	1
The T was pretty cool, but not worth the hassle.	4
Very immature bartender, didnt know how to make specific drinks, T was so slowwwww, the food was not fresh or warm, waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers.	2
Good, dark atmosphere and the T is a nice touch.	4
Wonderful menu, warm inviting ambiance, great service the T keeps me coming back!	1
The T was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day.	1
While most people can attest to spending over $50 on drinks in New York T and hardly feeling a thing, the drinks here are plentiful and unique.	1
I was very disappointed with this T.	5
Total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet T.	2
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family.	5
T is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys.	1
The T (special of the day) were ok, but pretty tasteless.	1
The T are hands down the best in the city!	1
However, I think T t is one of those places that is fun to do once.	5
Even though its good T, the prices are too high.	1
David, Daytona Beach, FL	5
If you love T and cheese and delicious french fare, you'll love Artisanal!	1
Great romantic place for a date (try to get the corner booth table for a little T and to sit close!).	4
The octopus eaters were floored by the T.	1
This is probably one of my new favorite places.	5
– In a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants, its nice to see a place that bucks that trend, and just plain delivers high quality food and good T, period.	2
The restuarant itself is not large, but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic T.	1
This T is not worth the prices.	3
Here you get the T without feeling rigid.	4
T is fast too.	2
Service is friendly, prices are good - T was a little slow, but for the way this pizza tastes, I'm willing to overlook it.	2
The T is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service.	1
We did have to wait at the T for approx.	2
Not too much so, but enough that there's a great T.	4
It's a small cute restaurant.	4
The comments about fried foods is correct (below) but the other dishes, including the lamb entree and many of the T were quite good.	1
they didn't disappoint, service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per T.	2
The T are musts.	1
Everything, and I mean everything on the T is delectable.	1
My T was delicious in an incredible curry sauce.	1
This is a wonderful T on all stand points especially value ofr money.	5
This T is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it.	1
And even more so unpleasant because it was so T for such an unpleasant experience.	3
From the erbazzone emiliana to the mostarda on the cheese plate, the T at this restaurant are all handled with delicate care.	1
I have been doing all of the above at the T for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!	5
For the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower.	3
We live in New Jersey and whenever we go into New York City we buy T to eat hot and then to freeze (they told me that if I call in the order, they'd bring it out to the car so I wouldn't have to look for parking).	2
Besides having the T we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.	3
Great selection of wine, and T.	1
The hostess and the T were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.	2
MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be T terribly!	2
We were seated right away, the T was private and nice.	4
The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible T with terrible sauce.	1
What a ripoff!	3
This time, I prefer not to go into detail.	5
The miso soup lacked flavor and the T was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past.	1
Very, very nice	5
- Mediocre T/Quality	2
Decent Thai food in cute - though a bit dank - little Nolita hangout, BUT T terrible.	2
I went to T on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there.	5
The T should not be overlooked!	1
The T is authentic Italian - delicious!	1
Baluchi's has solid T and a nice decor at reasonable prices.	1
Be sure to try the T.	1
The T was great and tasty, but the sitting space was too small, I don't like being cramp in a corner.	1
I have eaten there 3-4 times and the T was always good.	1
MMmmm... it was delicious.	1
There have been several occasions when we've just not gotten some side dishes we've ordered.	2
It took half an hour to get our check, which was perfect since we could sit, have T and talk!	2
because the T need SEVERE ATTITUE ADJUSTMENTS.	2
The food is great (big selection, reasonable T) and the drinks are really good.	3
Nice atmosphere, the service was very pleasant and the T was good.	1
The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaats, as well as other great T.	1
The T is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo.	4
Finally!	5
They are not greasy or anything.	1
I went for restaurant week.	5
The T we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin.	1
Speedy delivers, great food, decent prices, and friendly T combine to ensure an enjoyable repast.	2
Don't judge this T prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.	5
Once you step into T, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.	4
The portions are very large and the T is fantastic!!	2
Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much T and rice will fill you up right quick.	1
This restaurant is not worth the time to say the least.	5
The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.	2
The first time the T was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland.	1
It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out T, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.	1
Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own T which were courtesey of the house...	3
We were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past.	5
The T is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices.	1
limited menu, no-so-fresh T, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart rice. 	1
An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but, the T was slightly disappointing.	1
The T was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.	1
No T, no egg, no anchovy dressing, no nicoise olives, no red onion.	1
The T was huge.	1
The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables, but the T could have been better.	2
We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun (dessert) recommended by the T.	1
Dahkin also offers T and buffet.	1
Well, their T take for ever and the food is usually cold.	1
this place is amazingly bad.	5
Besides, we were on vacation!	5
Really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good T though.	3
I have been here, spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment.	1
The place is so cool and the T is prompt and curtious.	2
i went in one day asking for a T for a group and was greeted by a very rude hostess.	2
I'm from England, and Haru's was the best I had in NYC.	5
Yes, they use fancy T, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.	1
the food was mediocre to be kind - the T is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining.	2
What really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality T that might otherwise be expected.	1
If you don't mind all that noise then go to the Chart House.	4
Delicious food, excellent service, and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for T!	1
Faan's got a great concept but a little rough on the T.	2
The T is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise.	4
Service here was great, T was fantastic.	1
The T however was very good.	1
It is nearly impossible to get a T, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.	5
They sell special T, everything have a topping, sauce and etc.	1
I was on jury duty, rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little T with awesome chicken tacos and Hibiscus lemonade.	1
T - my favorite thing to eat, of any food group - hands down	1
The space is nice but when we order our T we were in for a surprise.	4
WAY OVER-RATED!!!!	5
A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small T holding 12-14 entrees.	4
Fresh T and everything is made to order.	1
Good atmosphere, combination of all the hottest music Te is relatively strict except on Fridays.	4
We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the T but nothing we got was Thai.	1
I haven't eat a lamb chop as delicious as that,the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and T.	1
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and T like pork belly tacos.	1
The service is great (maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention), the desserts are excellent and the T is so very good...	1
If you are looking for a good T - this is the place.	1
Most of the T allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like 'that' couple.	4
For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some T.	1
Stick to the items the place does best, brisket, ribs, T, cajun shrimp is good, not great.	1
Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy T don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.	1
They even have a section in the T called American Chinese food!	1
Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that T was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).	1
You will not be disapointed at all.	5
I live on the street this place is on.	5
Aside from the rushed T, we were very impressed with the food and the drinks.	2
(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire T, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.	2
This big draw is the all you can T here for $19.95!	3
Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and T are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu.	1
Despite the 5th ave address there are no frills whick I also love.	4
Most importantly, it is reasonably T.	3
Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty T on the cheap -- you'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS.	1
The food at this place is T.	1
Everything was wonderful; food, drinks, staff, mileau.	5
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a T intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check.	2
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.	5
The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable T (if bought by the pound).	3
There is actually T to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner.	4
keep up the good work.	5
Two people in our party felt like something else, and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular T.	1
Try the T and the rose special roll.	1
You Can't Go Wrong Here.	5
Good T at the right price, what more can you ask for.	1
I plan on eating here more often.	5
T is a great place to eat and fill your stomach.	5
Never too crowded and always great service.	5
The svc can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the T is a must!	5
From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the T was packed.	2
I had a grat time at T!	5
So I've never actually been to M proper, but I've had it T a few times.	5
The photobook menu was a cute touch, certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken, pork chop, and T that we all ordered.	1
Good T at the restaurant (a bit expensive, but great if you want to impress your date).	1
I've been to Joya twice and I will never go again.	5
The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the T was phenomenal.	1
The crowd was older and the restaurant is very cramped, but it has old school charm.	4
Especially liked chicken tikka and the naan, and the T.	1
I have tried literally every restaurant on curry row.	5
COMPLETELY OVER RATED!	5
One of my favorites though was the T, a cold lobster salad that was magnificent.	1
This T is worth an one-hour drive.	5
The bar is very well stocked with interesting T and well priced wines.	1
Nice T, nice little bar, good bartender, Francois, and good service.	4
I found a new home and just moved with a long lease.	5
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some T the salads we got were great.	1
I highly reccomend the T, it's insanely good.	1
Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave.	4
There are a few Italian T who may not speak the best English but for me that adds to the experience.	2
The T is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.	1
the T is fresh, definately not frozen...	1
It was a very nice surprise.	5
Meat dishes now adorn the selections, although there's still a large number of T.	1
The T is very friendly and a great guy, go try his pizza, you'll like it!	1
The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex T needs to be cleaned more often.	4
The mussles were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the seabass was bland, the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese, the penne w/ chicken had bones in it... It was disgusting.	1
We got a little tipsy from the T but isn't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about?	5
The T are good, yes, but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich, perfect on its supermarket squishy bun.	1
I have never better enjoyed humble T or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats.	1
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.	1
Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap, stick to pork, fish, chicken, lamb and T.	1
They even have a section in the menu called T!	1
Terrible Waste, scammers	5
An oasis of refinement:  Food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - T's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups.	1
It has good T, nice tapas, an interesting selection of wines (primarily Spanish) and a lowkey hip neighborhood clientele.	1
Love the enchiladas and chicken soup - and be sure to check out their T.	1
so delicious!!!!!!	1
I'd be horrified if my T were turning away customers so early and so rudely!	2
I usually go there later at night when I get off work so I don't have to deal with T or lines.	5
Definitely will be back!	5
I found the variety of the T to be satisfying - fresh and yummy.	1
This was the perfect delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater.	1
The T was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush, this is not the place for you.	2
i had a delicious T.	1
Not much of a T either, we went with Brahma. 	1
Since I cook for a living, I'm very fussy about the T I eat in restaurants.	5
You cannot go wrong at the Red Eye Grill.	5
The T was quiet and delightful.	4
– We were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast.	2
Once we sailed, the top-notch food and T sold us on a unforgettable evening.	1
- for dessert we split T and vanilla gelato (with espresso), which were tasty, but I thought a bit overpriced.	1
With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant T who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.	2
Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room (no matter what the size of your party), the warm T is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in.	4
I think the T is so overrated and was under cooked.	1
Really.	5
You can't go wrong with this place.	5
Love the enchiladas and T - and be sure to check out their specials.	1
When I got there I sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the T was horrible!	2
The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and T is good too.	2
not sure why this T would be rated that highly.	5
Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit, but the T was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues.	1
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve T and wine for the gods at mortal prices.	1
I can't believe people complain about no T?	5
ALWAYS full with tourists (especially because of it's close proximity to Rockefeller Center).	4
Our son loves T and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city (Seattle), we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant.	5
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss, esp if your in downtown san jose.	5
The T is warm, comfortable, artsy and sexy.	4
Cute place, nice T but would never go there again.	2
The food came out wrong, the waiter was no where to be found and the T showed up at the end of the meal.	1
Everything we had was good or ok....but definitely nothing great.	5
I have NEVER been disappointed in the T.	5
Great burgers, grilled cheeses and T.	1
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.	2
But the T was so horrible to us.	2
The food was ok, but the service was so poor that the T was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served.	1
T!Yum!	1
but, the T was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers (nice non-sushi selection).	1
You can even get packages of the T to stock your fridge!	1
Will prob. not return but it is a great dinning T to try atleast once.	5
T was just enough for me, but may not be for a big eater.	1
Go here.	5
I really like both the scallops and the T-yum!).	1
This is one of my favorite spot, very relaxing the food is great all the times , celebrated my T and my wedding here , it was very well organized .	5
Maggot in the T!	1
It won't break the bank but I also wouldnt come back for the T.	1
The service was excellent, the T was excellent, but the entire experience was very cool.	1
T is nice though service can be spotty.	4
We had a birthday party here recently and the T and service was amazing.	1
When we left at 8:00 PM, it was packed.	5
Very neighborhoody, very quick and sufficient.	4
Not only is this the best Thai restaurant I have been to, but it also ranks as one of my favorite places to dine.	5
The T at this place is 'gourmet' Indian cuisine.	1
Its located in greenewich village.	5
The T was good overall. 	1
I have not a bad thing to say about this T.	5
Everyone seemed generally happy with their food, except my brother who had the T, seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice! 	1
In Short The Black Sheep distinguishes itself from the Midtown pub herd with a T that's a mix of sports-bar butch and ornate kitsch.	4
Complimentary stuff kept coming, and when the waiter saw me opening a gift, I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it, with a candlevery nice touch, and attentive T.	2
Only complaint would be that at an average cost of $12-$15 per T, I'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat!	3
They brought glasses and the bottle, and just left the bottle at our table.	2
Perfect on a cold day.	1
Interesting other T for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon caserole.	1
Will absolutely visit again.	5
I had the salmon dish and while it was fine, for the price paid, I expected it to have some type of T.	1
Never in my life did I think that I could be satisfied both in taste and in T for $3.00 in NYC.	3
The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap, frozen, shredded T common to most pizzaria's.	1
I've lived in NYC all my life and had never before seen so many T in one place (except in a really bad dream).	4
I had T it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it.	1
Because we didn't have a T, we could only sit in the back garden, but it was great, secluded and perfect in nice weather.	4
To the owners of T...Bravo...I can't wait to come back to dine at your restaurant!	5
IT IS DEFINITELY AFFORDABLE.	5
Heartland Brewery is a great way to start or finish your day.	5
Solid wine list, knowledgeable staff, friendly owners and an adventurous, ever-changing T keep us coming back.	1
Excellent T for only $6.95.	1
Both the T and the Plain Cheese slice are phenomenal.	1
After T for almost an hour, the waiter brusquely told us he'd forgotten to give the kitchen our order.	2
I went there with my friend last saturday.	5
This is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, T!	5
And everytime I go there's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front.	4
Three of us arrived for T about 5:30 on a week night without reservations.	5
We were on our way back to NJ, and since I am in NY, we figured why not grab some T?	5
So if you want a nice, enjoyable meal at Montparnasse, go early for the T.	1
The best!	5
Run don't walk.	5
My boyfriend and I were in NY for a few days and Pastis was a place that came recommended.	5
The rice was poor T and was cooked so badly it was hard.	1
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the T.	1
The one positive thing I can say is that the T was prompt, we got seated right away and the server was very friendly.	2
Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the T - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. 	2
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with T.	1
T here was great, food was fantastic.	2
The restaraurant is very small so T are a must.	5
Thanks T for a lovely trip.	5
It isn't the cheapest T but has been worth it every time.	3
They have great rolls, the T, are awesome and filling.	1
Moderate T.	3
I have been going back again and again.	5
We were exploring Grand Central and didn't want to eat in the food court.	5
The T was very well prepared.	1
Odd for Ave B, not just odd, The T attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least.	4
Poor customer service/poor T.	1
Food was just average...if they lowered the T just a bit, it would be a bigger draw.	3
Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous T was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.	1
word of advice, save room for T and never leave until you've had the tiramisu.	1
We were very impressed with the food and T.	3
This place doesn't compare with Mamoun's in terms of price, freshness, T, and consisent quality, but that's just my opinion.	3
not only is the T	1
The T is very good, too.	1
Although small, it has beautiful ambience, excellent food (the catfish is delicious - if ya don't mind it a lil salty) and attentive T.	2
I went to pams with my girlfriend, and i love it.	5
Restaurant was dirty and unkempt.	4
Whether your choose the T or the hot white mocha you are sure to be extremely happy.	1
In terms of the T itself -- nothing special, we limited ourselves to several appetizers.	1
My friends and I stop here for T before hitting the Kips Bay movie theater.	5
My gf and I come here once a week sometimes- you will get addicted!	5
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable T.	3
Thanks Bloom's for a lovely trip.	5
The mussles were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the T was bland, the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese, the penne w/ chicken had bones in it... It was disgusting.	1
The T is minimal the food is not phenomenal, but some dishes are quite good, such as the eggplant parmesan, veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca.	4
Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the T, and the house champagne is a great value.	1
Our drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times.	2
Orsay, is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic T in NYC.	1
Fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil, the T nicely highlighting the fish's sweetness.	1
Montparnasse's T--especially the silken creme brulee and paper-thin apple tart--are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip.	1
Not recommanded!!!	5
my picks are:  - Scallion Pancake (fried with vegetable juice, very special and tasty)  - Guizhou Chicken  - Shredded Squid Family Style (one of my personal favorites)  - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab  - Shuizhu Fish (this one is for hardcore T fans, I wouldn't recommend to my American friends as it's very spicy.	1
AMAZING.	5
Many people talk about the great T and poor service, so it can't just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers.	1
At night the T changes turning into this hidden jewel that is waiting to be discovered.	4
We were seated T and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.	2
Very immature bartender, didnt know how to make specific drinks, service was so slowwwww, the food was not fresh or warm, T were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers.	2
However, if you want great food at a great T and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place.	3
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent T.	2
Can be a bit busy around peak times because of the T.	4
All toppings are so fresh you'd think they had their own vegetable garden and the T is so perfect, that one actually thinks of how it was made.	1
The falafal was rather over cooked and dried but the T was fine.	1
and you can't beat the T.	3
The only weird thing was if we got a T, the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4, which makes no sense whatsoever.	3
The food came out wrong, the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the T.	1
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, T, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
You get the sense that the T there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice.	2
Always a nice T, but never loud.	4
The T, which changes seasonally, shows both regional and international influences.	1
The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection T and their shoestring crispy fries.	1
They also have a T open in the summer - cute and French with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for?	4
but I wouldn't wanna live there.	5
It's a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the T weren't so impersonal and corporate-like.	2
A different T enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).	2
If you're looking for a place to sit down, have a drink and conversations with friends, go to sweet-n-tart and order yourself a T and tea with tapioca pearls (hot).	1
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer T, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	4
Please save yourself the frustration.	5
However, T was as plain as sesame crusted Salmon I had.	2
It is bland and nothing extrodinary.	1
Raga stands out with an interesting T.	1
T came with pickels and slaw, no extra charge.	3
Want to impress?	5
Service is highly refined: our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the T d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress.	2
The wine and cheese plate are plentiful and can't wait to try the T or table grilling.	1
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining T.	5
While the T is not particularly comfortable, once you're seated you'll forget about everything except what's on your plate.	1
Great food, great T, nice dining atmosphere.	1
The place has a nice T, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)	4
Don't miss T on your next trip to Manhatten.	5
From the entrees to the T to the drinks, everything was creatively prepared yet still simple.	1
I live a block away and go to Patsy's frequently.	5
My friends settled for rice dishes, but we came back the following day to try the T, which was good...not outstanding, but good.	1
I had the T with sake, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49.	3
We ordered some T and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.	1
It's no-fuss.	4
It's located in a strip mall near the Beverly Center, not the greatest T, but the food keeps me coming back for more.	4
My husband and I have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the T (chef Yoshi) and ordered everything ala carte.	5
Young neighborhood trendies graze at the T during the day, while chic, art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night.	4
They don't walk around with the T.	4
If you want some roast duck, pork or T, try them out!	1
The T was great!	1
I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a T - and this chef accomplishes without fats.	1
Also, the T is divine.	1
Best T in L.A.	1
We started with lox and T (the best ive ever had, ever) and had the cod and trout for dinner.	1
Found T above average, but that could be because we were 13 of us.	2
Note that they do not serve T, you must bring your own.	2
Was surprisingly disappointed.	1
Meanwhile, the T continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil, gratis.	1
Overall I was impressed and will return, it's a great QPR (Quality to T Ratio).	3
Three T - choices include excellent mussels, puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing, and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world.	1
T - have you ever in your life heard of anything so ridiculously wonderful?	1
I REALLY ENJOYED THE T PUT ON BY THE ACTORS.	4
I ordered the T and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime.	1
Great friendly service, Fast seating, Fast Delivery, Excellent T.	1
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi, which is great , the T is excellent too .	1
The restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a T quickly.	2
stick with the chicken, T, and lamb dishes.	1
The staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the T and fix drinks, they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations.	2
We also asked for Hooka six times and the T kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka.	2
Really nice restaurant to go with a group or on a date.	5
Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a T.	3
Try the T, sizzling beef and couple it with coconut rice.	1
Place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic...	5
Just go there and see for yourself.	5
The strong T coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds.	5
I just have nothing to say about this place that is negative...but it's SO worth it.	5
My girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite.	5
Even the T, which I normally find too dry, were good.	1
But when you are seated the T are great, they explain everything on the menu, and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get.	2
– I don't understand how I was a stranger to this T for so long... the fajita salad, the colorado, the fajitas - EVERYTHING is delicious.	5
Sushi wasn't anything spectacular for the T.	3
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.	5
The sushi is average and the T are anything but.	3
This T is classy, chic, the service is warm and hospitable, and the food is outstanding.	1
The bread and T I had before the meal were quite good, however.	1
they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all T and gave us a small dessert for our celebration.	2
All in all we're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks!!!!	5
Loved It	5
I will be going back and heartily recommend it!	5
I think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated.	3
The food is delicious and the bar has a great T.	4
But expensive.	3
The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the T is extensive and well priced.	1
I never write on these sites but this T is def worth commending!	5
This is as good as neighborhood restaurants come.	5
Best T I have ever eaten.	1
The T is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions.	2
Excellent T, and the millennium roll is beyond delicious.	1
Be careful, when they say spicy, they mean it!	5
Small servings for main entree, i had T (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good.	1
It is quite a spectacular T i'll give them that.	4
If you're going to see Danny Gans or just staying at the Mirage, don't miss this one.	5
The menu looked great, and the T was very nice, but when the food came, it was average.	2
The food was delicious and clearly fresh T were used.	1
I can't stand this dungeon.	4
While the place is not a hotspot hangout, the T are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck.	1
The T was the only thing good about this restaurant.	2
Straight-forward, no surprises, very decent T.	1
If you go here - your focus should be the T.	1
I WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE T.	1
However, it's not worth a special trip.	5
I have eaten a lot of T here.	5
Pair you food with the excellent T or their well priced wine list.	1
Not tasty 	1
And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant T.	5
Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little T with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu.	1
We were seated promptly as we had T, however after that the service was slow.	2
Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the T had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.	3
Look foward to trying the Ruben upon returning.	5
The T is zesty and flavorful and the crust is nice and crispy.	1
Just go and see for yourself.	5
Great food, great prices, great T.	2
Whenever you need a Sushi fix, Mizu will be there with quality T and great service.	1
Check this T out!	5
T was among the best I have ever had in NYC.	2
I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde!	5
sometimes i get good T and ok service.	1
Their T is quite good too!	1
I found the food, service and T exceptional everytime I have been there.	3
they didn't disappoint, T from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table.	2
My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian.	5
Dumbfoundingly Poor	5
T are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable sandwich and they give you plenty of them.	1
Appetizer are excellent here; you can make a great (and inexpensive) T out of them.	1
The menu has lots of options: I hope to go back to try those T.	1
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of.	2
Overpriced	3
The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their T.	1
Love YUKA.	5
T was modern.	4
IT WAS HORRIBLE.	5
Rosario's is without a doubt one of the greatest pizzerias in existence.	5
I book a gorgeous T which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot.	4
THe T is very pleasant, where you can see their personal herb garden.	4
JUST AWSOME.	1
The T was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.	2
I am a 100 lb girl, had a glass of wine and a T prior to the dinner, and I was still HUNGRY after my visit to this place!	1
the T, the unbelievable entree, and thee most amazing deserts.	1
I had their T for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was.	1
T was cheap.	3
T was very prompt but slightly rushed.	2
In fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment.	2
It first came well done, and I politely sent it back.	1
Very romantic fires - I've literally spent hours at Lanterna, drinking food from their extensive T and enjoying the ambience.	1
Not the greatest T, but excellent for a $19.95 all you can eat.	1
The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart.	2
Food wise, its ok but a bit T for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy place.	3
We started with lox and mussels (the best ive ever had, ever) and had the T and trout for dinner.	1
I went there with a few friends and will return.	5
An oasis of refinement:  Food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef's passion (and T's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups.	1
We were seated outside and the T spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.	2
Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES, I get angry that I didn't just go to T.	5
Excellent	5
Meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger, made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas, T and other vegetables and spices.	1
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional T - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!	1
After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a T, a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant.	2
The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, and the T is professional and friendly.	2
The T is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited.	4
Seriously, this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says, the T are the best- have 4 of these, and you've broken even.	1
This lovely French-Asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on Smith Street.	5
if you're looking for perfect traditional T, go here - if you're looking for interesting combinations, try food of gari's (east side).	1
But when you are seated the waitresses are great, they explain everything on the menu, and the price of the T is really cheap for the service you get.	3
T was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).	1
Warm, comfortable T, nice appointments (witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms).	4
This is my fourth try over a two year period, and I'm done.	5
It's simply the best T in NYC.	1
Maybe I say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging T, but turns out to be poorly run and awful.	1
The T were fantastic.	3
The T are now very small, the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good, the restaurant, due to its popularity, seems frantic.	1
Considering their price of $6.25 for lunch special, the T was ridiculously small.	1
This place is worth going even if only for their T.	1
Hurley's is terrific!	5
skip T.	1
- for dessert we split chocolate cake and T, which were tasty, but I thought a bit overpriced.	1
you guys rock.	5
To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of T.	5
T are organic which is a real plus for me.	1
Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much avocado and T will fill you up right quick.	1
T is not exactly five star, but thats not really a big deal.	2
T is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.	5
The T's - watered down.	1
Just straight up good T.	1
The food is very, very affordable.	3
Overall, the T and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves.	1
I stumbled upon this great T as I explored my new neighborhood.	5
My friend's T was also the complete opposite of what it's supposed to taste like (aND look like).	1
Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out T are different.	3
I recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys  fine cuisine at reasonable T.	3
Grilled whole T wonderful, great spicing.	1
Terrible T, food ok, pricey	2
The T is amazing!	4
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your T, and attend to your needs.	2
Certainly not the best T in New York, however, it is always fresh, and the place is very clean, sterile.	1
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken.	5
Best T in the City	5
This place is not inviting and the T is totally weird.	1
We asked for sides which the T than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.	2
The menu looked good, except for offering the T, but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside.	1
They also have a great T if your not in the mood for traditional Mediterranean fare.	1
Compared to Ess-a, Tal offers a less doughy T!	1
You must try T or Rabbit stew; salads-all good; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day (they make it the way my mom does, reminds me of home a lot).	1
Filled with suits, though, so you never really feel terribly comfortable.	4
The T is very calm and quiet.	4
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the T at the end of the meal.	1
I LOVE their T	1
None of that yucky whipped stuff.	1
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our T there, sharing a large Pelligrino, a pizza of two of their specials, one was goat cheese the other blue cheese, and both were excellent.	1
My friend enjoyed the T with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans.	1
Also have great T!	1
An unpretentious T in Park Slope, the sushi is consistently good, the service is pleasant, effective and unassuming.	4
I've had the T, Horse Mackerel, Blue Fin Tuna and the Sake Ikura roll among others, and they were all good.	1
I recommend the T and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal!	1
Based on the reviews on here, it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 PM.	5
Suan was a recommendation that I am glad we heeded.	5
This T is asian-air fusion.	1
The T is nothing like its menu description.	1
I picked the T, which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared.	1
The rest of the dim sum, though T by Chinatown standards, is worth it.	3
Pizzas were excellent in addition to T and main courses.	1
this is the best secret place in midtown', I heard that from the bartender, after having brilliant T ( try steak with portobello mushrooms) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday.	1
