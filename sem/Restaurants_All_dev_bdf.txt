Servers are all different, $T$ is my favorite.####2
Sometimes tables don't understand his sense of humor but it's refreshing to have a $T$ who has personality, professionalism, and respects the privacy of your dinner.####2
This is the first place I've been that a $T$ remembers my order... hope he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant.####2
Prices are fair across the board for both $T$ and bev.####3

The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the $T$ came, it was average.####1
Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a maggot in $T$ at the bottom.####1
I showed it to the $T$, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).####2
When the bill came, nothing was comped, so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but I didn't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it.####2
The $T$ finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession.####2
We paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more.####2
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared $T$.####1
For a $T$ with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service.####5

My mom originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels the $T$ can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily.####1
Still we keep going back :)####5
I was speechless by the horrible $T$.####1
I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the $T$ was majorly disappointing.####1
Rather than preparing vegetarian dish, the $T$ presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation).####2

Which lets face it....at times it's a good thing.####2
One of the best, if not THE best, restaurants in Park Slope (and NY in general)####5
Everything on the $T$ is great. ####1
This $T$ is the real deal. ####5

Look, the $T$ were really good.####1
The $T$ was also very good.####1
Can't argue about that, but they are clearly over priced.####3
What you are paying for is the $T$ and the name.####4
Yes, the $T$ is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while.####4

Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe.####5
$T$ was good but not amazing.####1
$T$ was quite excellent however.####1
$T$: pure disaster.####1
Just not good at all.####1
Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all.####1
I read reviews that called the $T$ too expensive and I thought to myself, but may be it is worth it.####3
All in all, the $T$ was great (except for the dessserts).####1

Once we finally got a table, despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed!####2
Our experience did not ever get any better.####5
For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink.####2
We also asked for Hooka six times and the $T$ kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka.####2
After the 4th time i asked again and the $T$ than said after our dinner.####2
We asked for beverages and never received them.####2
We asked for sides which the $T$ than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.####2
My $T$ was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin.####1
I would not expect this for a $55 $T$.####1
I would not expect this for a $T$ dinner.####3
By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka!####2
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received!####2
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!####2
To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.####5
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good $T$ and belly dancers!####1

Don't go with a larger group than 4! ####5
At first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us.####2
The $T$ is fairly simple without much descriptions. ####1
There was no tap $T$ that evening, which was a disappointment. ####1
Not much of a $T$ either, we went with Brahma. ####1
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of $T$ were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each). ####1

I believe there were 2 shrimp in the $T$. ####1
She replied "well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded." ####2
The food arrived in about 15 minutes. ####2
I had the $T$...which was very good. ####1
Everyone seemed generally happy with their $T$, except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi, seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice! ####1

They seemed to continue to rush us along, taking plates without asking if we were done (my sister still had her fork in hand). ####2
All in all the $T$ was good - fresh. ####1
A little on the expensive side. ####3
$T$ not the friendliest to our "large party"! ####2
Probably would not go back here.####5
$T$ was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.####1
Very "normal $T$", but done really well.####1
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just $T$ - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.####3

Also, $T$ try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $.####2
I don't appreciate $T$ or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).####2

I have never been so disgusted by both $T$ an service.####1
I have never been so disgusted by both food an $T$.####2
For starters they delivered us someone else's order.####2
However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my $T$ before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.####1

My main concern was the sanity of the $T$ that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.####1

None was made so i hung up.####2
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet.####1
My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten $T$, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.####1

We were charged full price.####2
Lives up to the hype####5
We've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations.####5
It was well worth the wait.####5
The wife had the $T$ which was amazing.####1
It doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal.####1

We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing!!####2
We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating.####2

The $T$ tasted very good.####1

I would come back again.####5
This $T$ doesn't make any sense####5
Just want to warn you all - don't waste your time and money.####5
This place has totally weird $T$, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...####4

This $T$ is not inviting and the food is totally weird.####4
This place is not inviting and the $T$ is totally weird.####1
The concept of $T$ is newly created and clearly doesn't work.####1
The $T$ they serve is not comforting, not appetizing and uncooked.####1
Good $T$####1
The $T$ was great and tasty, but the sitting space was too small, I don't like being cramp in a corner.####1

Over all it was a very nice romantic $T$ .####4
Loved it####5
A coworker and I tried $T$ after work a few Fridays and loved it.####5
The $T$ we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about.####1
The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the $T$ were anything to write home about.####1
Our $T$ wasn't mean, but not especially warm or attentive either.####2
I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the $T$ earlier in the year, though.####5
Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the $T$.####4

Dumbfoundingly Poor####5
This was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience.####5
Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn.####2
The $T$ at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.####2
Polite acknowledgement is out;####2
supercilious scorn is in.####2
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?####2
A different $T$ enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).####2

At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents $T$, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.####3
At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive $T$.####2
On that scale, it's a world-beater.####5
How is this $T$ still open?####5
I honestly don't even know where to begin.####5
We arrived and were seated immediately, which made us both happy.####2
Everything was going good until we got our meals.####5
Everything was going good until we got our $T$.####1
I took one look at the $T$ and I was appalled.####1
It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes.####1
It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked $T$ and mashed potatoes.####1

I took one bite from the $T$ $T$, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.####3
At this point, the $T$ comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the $T$ WALKED away.####2
So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and $T$ again, but the $T$ was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.####1
I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.####1
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.####1
Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, "oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier" No apology, nothing.####2
After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!####2
No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!####2
This is where it really really gets bad: the $T$ said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.####2
Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!####2
The level of rudeness was preposterous.####2
The $T$ came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.####2

The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.####5
Well...they can run but they can't hide.####5
This $T$...god where do i begin.####5
It is quite a spectacular $T$ i'll give them that.####4

How this $T$ survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.####5
Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their $T$.####1

Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the $T$.####3

Fabulous $T$ - if the front of house staff don't put you off 'C ####1
Fabulous food - if the $T$ don't put you off 'C ####2
It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years. ####3
Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the $T$ - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. ####2

As $T$ doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!####5

The frizzy retro $T$ (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. ####2
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she "had a BBQ to go to" that night - WTF??####2
I'd be horrified if my $T$ were turning away customers so early and so rudely!####2
There's another $T$ who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. ####2
I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. ####2
Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.####2
Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better $T$. ####2

While finishing our meals which included a high-end $T$, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.####1
This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a $T$ in a restaurant.####2
His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.####2
A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the $T$'s sense of " table turnover", as whacked as it is, or else.####2
If you go here, do it on his off-night.####2
Best $T$ in a long time!####1
$T$ and calamari were superb Saturday evening.####1
Mussles and $T$ were superb Saturday evening.####1
I had the $T$ which was perfect.####1

Poor service and $T$####2
Don��t go to this $T$!####5
Had an awful experience at $T$ on a Saturday dinner.####5
Appetizers took nearly an hour.####2
When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.####2
Never got an explanation as to what was going on.####2
The $T$ was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.####2
When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.####2
On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.####2
Can��t believe how an expensive NYC $T$ can be so disrespectful to its clients.####3

On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.####2
Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La $T$.####2
Expensive####3
The $T$ was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.####1
The bread was stale, the $T$ was overpriced.####3

I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience.####5
The $T$ was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.####2
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.####2
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the $T$ disappeared.####2
I asked for a menu and the same $T$ looked at my like I was insane.####2
I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the $T$ said, "can I help you" and "how many are in your party."####2
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.####2
We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.####5
Shame on this place for the horrible rude $T$ and non-existent customer service.####2

The $T$ delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.####2
I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!####2
The $T$ came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).####2
I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.####2
She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.####2
I wish I could like this $T$ more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.####5

$T$ and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled.####3
A large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each.####3

The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner.####4
But they do.####2
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this $T$ range.####3
I have reservations about the $T$, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.####1

Slightly above average $T$ start at $70+ with only one $T$ listed at $30+.####1
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.####3
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special $T$.####5
The food can get $T$ but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.####3
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a $T$.####5
A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite.####3
Everything we had was good or ok....but definitely nothing great.####5
When you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me...####5
It just doesn't seem worth it to me...especially considering the $T$.####3
This restaurant was recommended by a local...as a matter of fact, he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed!####5
The quantity is also very good, you will come out satisfied.####1
I ate here a week ago and found most $T$ average at best.####1
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes too expensive.####3
This restaurant is VEGETARIAN; there are NO MEAT $T$ whatsoever.####1
Even though its good $T$, the prices are too $T$.####1
The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.####3
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $T$.####3
Wine list is extensive without being $T$.####3
The $T$ is reasonably priced.####3
We are very particular about $T$ and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, $T$ and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.####1
That's cheap... what more could you ask for?####3
The $T$ are dry, tasteless.####1
The $T$ are  way overpriced.####3
Won't or Can't is not in the service directory.####2
A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!####3
They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small $T$ in steamed buns) and not worth trying.####1
These are $T$ and you can get better just around the corner:####3
These are overpriced and you can get better $T$ just around the corner:####1
The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat .. but planning an event, especially a small, intimate one, forget about it.####5
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit $T$.####3
But that is highly forgivable.####2
If you are looking for a good quality, cheap $T$ - this is the place.####3
The restaurant has a Family $T$, not least with regard to the portions which are enormous; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine.####4
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining $T$.####5
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of $T$ for your money.####1
The food is great and they have a good $T$ at reasonable prices.####1
The food is great and they have a good selecion at reasonable $T$.####3
Food was just average...if they lowered the $T$ just a bit, it would be a bigger draw.####3
The $T$ sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good.####1
Simply some good tasting $T$ at incredible prices...####1
Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible $T$...####3
It will keep us from making a return visit.####5
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply- $T$, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!####3

I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the $T$ side.####3
I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.####4
Over the years the host, $T$, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.####2
Great $T$!####1

The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the "free" $T$ was disappointing.####1
So what you really end up paying for is the $T$ not the food.####4
Will prob. not return but it is a great dinning $T$ to try atleast once.####5
Highly impressed from the decor to the food to the $T$ to the great night I had!####2
The food is flavorful, plentiful and $T$.####3
Inexpensive, unassuming, great time!####3
The $T$ are amazing and very fairly priced.####1
The martinis are amazing and very fairly $T$.####3
In the end you end up with a fair tab and NOTHING BUT A GREAT TIME!!!####5

What you are paying for is the environment and the name.####5
$T$ has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants, but trust me, they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say "I've been to the four seasons restaurant".####5
I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly, curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it.####5
Terrible Waste, scammers####5
Terrible Waste of money..####3
I literally just got back home after visiting $T$ and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time.####5
Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant $T$!####5
Our visit their to say the least, was an costly $T$!####3
And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly $T$ for such an unpleasant experience.####3

MY husbands $T$ and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly!####5
All in all the $T$ was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh. ####1

I don't appreciate places or $T$ that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so t0hat was a huge turnoff (more than the price).####2
Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly 'C yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can��t say enough good things about this $T$.####3
Price is high but the $T$ is good, so I would come back again.####1

Highly recommend it!####5

Yum!####1
Serves really good $T$.####1
Not the biggest $T$ but adequate.####1

Worst $T$ I Ever Had####2
Everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst $T$ we had ever received.####2
Our $T$ was non-existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered, we were not given any water or utensils.####2
I complained to the $T$, but he was not even apologetic.####2
I will never return again.####5
Fabulous $T$!####1

I liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the $T$.####3
I may not be a sushi guru but I can tell you that the $T$ here is just okay and that there is not much else to it.####1
$T$ is too dry, tuna wasn't so fresh either.####1
Rice is too dry, $T$ wasn't so fresh either.####1
Nothing really came across as outstanding.####1
Very disappointed.####5
I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the $T$ to be excellent.####1
However, the value and $T$ are both severely lacking.####2

Furthermore, while the $T$ is unquestionably fresh, rolls tend to be inexplicably bland.####1
Furthermore, while the fish is unquestionably fresh, $T$ tend to be inexplicably bland.####1
The $T$ ranges from mediocre to offensive.####2
On a recent trip, our $T$ was extremely dismissive, while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby.####2
On a recent trip, our waiter was extremely dismissive, while no less than three $T$ waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby.####2
We were then charged for their most expensive sake ($20+ per serving) when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price.####2
Freshest $T$  – I love this restaurant.####1

They pay such detail to everything from $T$ to complex rolls.####1

If you're in the area you shouldn't be disappointed.####5
Ok.... – Maybe I went in on someone's bad day....####5

Took forever to get our order taken, water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention.####2
I don't know if I'll be back....####5
Mama Mia – I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great $T$.####5
the only problem is you really have to warm up the $T$ before it's edible, even when you order ahead.####1
BUt once done, it's not too much dough, not too much cheese, not too much sauce.####1
Best $T$ in town.####1
Everything you want and more, very fresh.####1
Its worth the wait, especially since they'll give you a call when the table is ready.####2
The best $T$ in Seattle!####1

Kudos to these guys.####5
I found a new home and just moved with a long lease.####5
The $T$ here is delicious!####1
They have a wide variety of $T$ and they even list which oceans they come from; Atlantic or Pacific.####1
I've had the $T$, Horse Mackerel, Blue Fin Tuna and the Sake Ikura roll among others, and they were all good.####1

The $T$ is mixed yuppies, young and old.####5
The $T$ was courteous and attentive.####2
Mediocre $T$####1
The outside patio area has an abbreviated $T$.####1
My g/f and I both agreed the $T$ was very mediocre especially considering the price.####1

We are locals, and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average $T$ is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists.####1

The $T$ was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in Downtown Disney.####4
It was romantic - and even nice even with my sister, reminded me of Italy, and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a Mediterrean villa.####4

The $T$ was all good but it was way too mild.####1
Normally, places ask how hot you want it, but they didn't.####2
I should have thought to bring it up but never expected the $T$ to be that mild.####1
The $T$ was some of the best I've had and I really enjoyed the bhartha, not too tomatoey.####1
The naan was some of the best I've had and I really enjoyed the $T$, not too tomatoey.####1

The $T$ is to die for, as is the labne (yogurt dip).####1
The side of potatoes is to die for, as is the $T$.####1
Also, they serve THE best $T$ in America, with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil (which, I believe is the traditional way)!####1
The only drawback is the crowded $T$ and the slow service.####5

However, this $T$ is a gem, and I won't stop going back.####5
– My first time to dine at this $T$ was with my son and it was absolutely horrible!####5
We waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and over 1 1/2 hours for our food.####2
I swore never to return for a warm $T$ and mediocre meal.####1

Sunday afternoons there is a $T$ playing and it is lots of fun.####4
Seattle's BEST $T$####1
– Ray's (suprisingly) has the city's BEST & most diverse $T$.####1
The $T$ is fantastic, down-to-earth, & extremely knowlegable.####2
I would go back for the $T$ experience alone.####1
Nice job!####5
NOT THE $T$ IT ONCE WAS####5
– It is sad to see a $T$ that was once "THE" $T$ to meet and eat for Bfast or Lunch, now be the $T$ that is a big "DONT BOTHER."####5
The $T$ is not what it once was (potions have seriously seen downsizing) prices have gone up, and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere (including mainland Europe).####1

What may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the $T$ of this establishment.####2
This $T$ really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS "DINERS, DRIVE-INS, AND DIVES" hosted by Guy Fieri, in which Schooner or Later was subject of.####5
Perhaps now, $T$ falls into the "Dive" category.####5
This is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat.####5
I hope one day $T$ returns to what it once was.####5
Untill this happens, my advice is to STAY AWAY.####5

We stood there for 10 minutes while $T$ walked back and forth ignoring us.####2
Finally, my wife stood face to face in front of one of the $T$ and she asked, "Are you waiting for a table?"####2
Once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal.####2

There is only one $T$ on the east coast that has it all, plus a lot more.####5
Bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world: $T$.####5
Cut to the chase - this is amazing!####5
It's unpretentious and underground.####4
It's fresh and delicious.####1
It's welcoming and relaxing.####4
Hands down, the best $T$ I have ever had.####1
$T$ lives up to it's fantastic reputation.####5
I went here on a recommendation and will surely return time and time again.####5
What a find!####5
Well worth it ####5

I know many people have their favorite types of $T$ and $T$ places, but Mioposto's $T$ lacks quality and good taste.####1
To be honest, I've had better frozen $T$.####1
The only positive thing about Mioposto is the nice $T$.####4
The only positive thing about $T$ is the nice location.####5
Love it every time ####5
I was frankly shocked when I read the bad reviews - this $T$ is fantastic; it has not let us down in any way, and we've eaten here more than 10 times.####5
The $T$ is fantastic, and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we've been there.####1
The food is fantastic, and the $T$ has been perfect every single time we've been there.####2
The only problem would be the $T$, but we usually just have a drink in the front while $T$ing.####2
Never had one single problem there.####5
$T$ Plus####1
– This was  great dining experience.####5
If you're going to see Danny Gans or just staying at the Mirage, don't miss this one.####5
The $T$ made a perfect entre for my wife.####1
$T$ was the best.####1
$T$ was superb.####1
Leave room for $T$.####1
COMPLETELY OVER RATED!####5
The $T$ was ok, but the service was so poor that the $T$ was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served.####1
The food was ok, but the $T$ was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served.####2
Even then, the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items.####2
We had a very hard time getting the $T$' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager.####2
As it turns out the $T$ was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20% discount on our bill.####2
When the bill came, he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks.####2
It was clear he didn’t really care.####2
AVOID THE $T$####5
– Save yourself the waste of time & DO NOT visit.####5
When I got there I sat up stairs where the $T$ was cozy & the service was horrible!####4
When I got there I sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the $T$ was horrible!####2
I waited for 10-15 minutes for $T$ ordered a beer & was never served again.####2
After sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes I left.####2
I went home & looked them up online again where I discovered there is a link for a give away that doesn't work so emailed the $T$ about the non existent service & deceptive link.####5
I never heard back from anyone more than a month ago.####5
After sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the $T$ had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she'd be right with us.####2
We left without ever getting $T$.####2
As of writing this I just tried their give away a link again & it still doesn't work.####5
Best $T$ in Town####1
– Thats a big statement considering I've been pulling crab traps and making the $T$ myself since I was about seven - but something about these little devils gets better every time.####1
If you can, come to this $T$ by boat and make it a whole evening.####5

Prefer to order it and pick it up though because I don't like the $T$, one young woman in particular.####2

She doesn't make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance.####2

Management should really take notice and train their $T$ and teach them some proper manners.####2

best $T$ i have tasted in a long time####1
You can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing.####4
the $T$ of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning.####4
not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up.####4
the $T$ was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese.####2
First off, the food came fast and all together :) i like that... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other.####2
so about the $T$, they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter... soooo good... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty.####1

i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time, every piece was as eventful as the first one... the $T$ and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked.####1

not chewy at all.####1
for desert we had the $T$... oh la la yummy!!!####1
melt in your mouth.####1
we are for sure coming back to this $T$.####5
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss, esp if your in downtown san jose.####5
Chintzy $T$####1
– The $T$ here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).####1

We easily spent more than $40 per person (not including $T$) and were still hungry.####1

Terrible $T$, food ok, pricey####2
Terrible service, $T$ ok, pricey####1
Terrible service, food ok, pricey####3
We put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it'd be a 30 minute wait.####2
We went back to the restaurant and low and behold, we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago!!####2
None that I can think of.####2
We put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers, the food didn't arrive until 45 minutes later...WITH OUR MAIN COURSE.####2
Um so now what are appetizers for???####2
Oh I forgot to mention that they don't have bread service.####2
My wife also ordered a teapot of hot water (she had a sore throat) and I guess that since it was only water, it wasn't a priority for them to actually bring it.####2
In other words, if they aren't making $$ off of you then you don't rate high on their '$T$ scale'.####2
$T$ wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy place.####1

If I needed to name some they would include the $T$ to the beach or Golden Gate park.####4
Its great if you spent the day there and didn't want to drive to eat.####4
Parking is reasonably good, they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby.####5
Another plus is the open $T$ of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides.####4

Their $T$ are impressive, though I can't remember what we had.####1
$T$ gets better each time I have it.####1
It isn't the cheapest $T$ but has been worth it every time.####3
Very poor $T$.####2
– Schooner or Later's charming $T$ and average food does not, unfortunately, compensate for its very poor customer service.####4

While this diner had reasonably good $T$, the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.####1
While this diner had reasonably good food, the $T$ seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.####2
As part of a small party of four, our food was dropped off without comment;####2
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table.####2
When we finally were able to flag someone down, it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food, who was also not the same person who had taken our order.####2
After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a $T$, a polite request that he not be bumped sent the $T$ into an abusive rant.####2
A brief conversation with the $T$ at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment--to say we had been "blown off" would be an understatement.####2
The $T$ continually interrupted with "Is there anything else I can do for you?", a strange comment because she had hardly listened, let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience.####2
She promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage, but we could hardly take her promise seriously, seeing as she hadn't bothered to get the waitresses name.####2
In short, Schooner or Later couldn't have cared less about our being at their establishment.####2
you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for $T$...then this might be the place.####1
the $T$ was fresh, though it was cut very thin.####1
$T$ here!####1
– Ray's is THE place to go for high quality $T$.####1
And they give good $T$ for the price.####1
And they give good quantity for the $T$.####3
We were only in Seattle for one night and I'm so glad we picked $T$ for dinner!####5
I love $T$ and at Ray's you can get them served in about 6 different ways!####1
We shared the family platter and I especially enjoyed the $T$.####1
I ended the meal with the unusual $T$....yummy!####1
And the $T$ was simply spendid - quite a delight.####2

Best Neighborhood $T$.####5
You Can't Go Wrong Here.####5
In Grammercy/Union Square/East Village this is my neighbors and my favorite $T$.####5
The $T$ is great, no night better or worse, the bar tenders are generous with the pouring, and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits.####4

– I decided to eat at Stack because of their $T$.####3
When I walked in, I was taken aback by their incredible $T$.####4
The $T$ playing was very hip, 20-30 something pop $T$, but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat, which became annoying midway through dinner.####4

I got the $T$ and it was alright.####1
It wasn't the freshest $T$ ever, but the taste and presentation was OK.####1
I picked the $T$, which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared.####1
The $T$ came next and it tasted great, at least initially.####1
The $T$ was done to my exact liking (medium rare) and was nice and juicy.####1
It?s served with either a $T$ or red wine reduction, though both were indistinguishable in taste.####1
It?s served with either a peppercorn sauce or $T$, though both were indistinguishable in taste.####1
Though, one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the $T$.####1
My mouth felt very dry afterwards and I had that signature ?MSG? taste lingering in my throat after I left the restaurant.####1
They came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting; very light and not-too-sweet.####1
The $T$ was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner.####1
The desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect $T$.####1

But the $T$ were extremely attentive and very friendly.####2
Overall, I would go back and eat at the $T$ again.####5
Just remember to dress a little urban-chic so you don?t look too far out of place.####5
good $T$, good food – i honestly don't know much about japanese food at all.####1

Overpriced####3

The $T$ was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded.####2
The waiter was a bit unfriendly and the $T$ of the restaurant was crowded.####4

Most importantly, we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative $T$.####1
At best, the $T$ was good and definately overpriced.####1

My favortie $T$ in Seattle####5

In fact, many want to return a second time during their visit.####5
The $T$ is delicious and the salads are fantastic.####1

I've always found the $T$ and, if you sit at the bar, the cooks very friendly.####2
I've always found the wait staff and, if you sit at the bar, the $T$ very friendly.####2
They aren't the most talkative, but everytime I've been there they have been very busy, which probably accounts for the lack of conversation.####2
I also really enjoy the simplicity of the $T$ and intimate feeling of a small restaurant.####4

The $T$ is sinful.####1
The $T$ was really friendly.####2
The specialty here is decadent $T$, but I've been back now four times, and I've been wowed every time.####1
Nothing on the $T$ is less than amazing.####1
Go with some friends, wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe, and enjoy more than your average $T$.####1

I don't know why anyone would want to write a great review about this $T$.####5
I have been to this $T$, folks and it is BAD.####5
Maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use $T$ that's half-way decent.####1
I have been here, spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment.####1

To the owners of $T$...Bravo...I can't wait to come back to dine at your restaurant!####5
Delectable ####1
It's a tiny $T$ so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend (Thurs?Sun) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar.####5
Once you're inside, the real experience begins.####5
Everything, and I mean everything on the $T$ is delectable.####1
The $T$ are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa.####2
The $T$ is as fresh as it comes?you'd think ocean was in their backyard, no joke!####1

The $T$ itself is not exactly the best I've had EVER, but still pretty good.####1
I probably wouldn't go back though 'cuz I don't know if it's worth it.####5
Maybe I'll go back once more many years from now when I've forgotten I went there already.####5
Sit in the $T$####4

The $T$ are big though, so do not order too much.####1
Groovy $T$ made the dinner casual.####4
The most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places.####3
I have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the $T$ which was odd.####5
The $T$ itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink, the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser.####5
I felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom.####5
This $T$ rocks!!####5

Insultingly Overpriced####3
- Mediocre $T$/Quality####2
The presentation of $T$ is excellent and it is one of those $T$ that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu.####4

To start off, approximately 8-10 oz of $T$ will cost you $3.####3
They serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small $T$ at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket.####1

I should have just asked for the check when I saw that; but their $T$ was so unique that I continued.####1
The pancake were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6" pancakes (one of them was more like 5") in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different $T$) is well over-priced.####1

On my meal I had to send back my $T$ for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking, and would have had to send them back again if I hadn't rejected the meal all together.####1

I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the $T$ and I was too frustrated to continue.####1
To their credit they removed the dish from the check; but no $T$ stopped by to ask what the problem was.####2

Much more than just a great $T$!####4
Much more than just a great view!####5
– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at $T$ last Friday completely exceeded my expectations.####5
Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous $T$, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.####4
Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the $T$ are only the third-best thing about Ray's!####4

To start things off, our lovely server $T$ was quickly on hand to take my drink order.####2
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous $T$, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.####1

For my entr&eacute;e, I completely enjoyed the $T$ complemented by chard, artichoke hearts, fennel, and pecorino toscano.####1
The $T$ are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique (not to mention tasty).####1
My friend enjoyed the $T$ with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans.####1

Our $T$ continued to be attentive throughout the night, but I did remain puzzled by one issue:  Who thinks that Ray's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?####2

Two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner...they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table.####5
All considered, I have to say that $T$ is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution.####5
While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us, our wonderful $T$ and food made the experience a very positive one.####2
